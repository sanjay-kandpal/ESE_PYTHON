Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comfortable,,,,Initmates
"Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8"".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.",,,,General
"I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c",,,,General
"I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and fabulous! every time i wear it, i get nothing but great compliments!",,,,General Petite
This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!,,,,General
"I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.",,,,General
"I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.",,,,General Petite
"I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size...",,,,General Petite
I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.,,,,General
"I'm 5""5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath.",,,,General
Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.,,,,General
This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering.,,,,General Petite
"More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid",,,,General Petite
"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees.",,,,Initmates
This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip,,,,General
"I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!",,,,General
"Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.",,,,General
Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.,,,,General
"A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5' 5'', about 135 and the small fits great.",,,,General
"I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too.",,,,General
"If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. 

fits nicely! i'm 5'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. 

the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting.",,,,General
"I'm upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb",,,,General
"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!",,,,General
"Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.",,,,General
"I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!",,,,General
"Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans",,,,Initmates
I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,,,,General
"The colors weren't what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn't find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn't for me, in the end.",,,,General
I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....,,,,Initmates
"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.",,,,General
Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these!,,,,General Petite
"I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer",,,,General Petite
These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.,,,,General Petite
"I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.",,,,General
"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!",,,,Initmates
"Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!",,,,General Petite
"This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design, it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops.",,,,General
"Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6"", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3"", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos.",,,,General
Super cute and comfy pull over. sizing is accurate. material has a little bit of stretch.,,,,Initmates
Great casual top with flare. looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans. flattering with peplum in back. nice cut for shoulders and neckline.,,,,General
"Pretty and unique. great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels. the colors, print, and embroidery are lovely. reasonably priced!",,,,General
"This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.",,,,General
"This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!!",,,,General
"First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3"" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot",,,,Initmates
"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!",,,,General
I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.,,,,General
I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.,,,,General
"Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering",,,,General
"This sweater is perfect for fall...it's roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops.",,,,General
"Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.",,,,General
"This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.",,,,General
"I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops.",,,,General
"Love the color and style, but material snags easily",,,,General
"Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun",,,,General
"Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.",,,,General
This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.,,,,General
"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!",,,,Initmates
This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.,,,,General
"I got this in the petite length, size o, and it fit just right. i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap, and really needs to be concealed with a belt, yet because it sits so high, literally right under the bustline, it's a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th",,,,General Petite
"I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra, could be a little more supportive. pretty color, with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.)",,,,Initmates
"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.",,,,General Petite
"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!",,,,Initmates
I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.,,,,General
"Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!",,,,General
Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!,,,,General
"Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate",,,,General
"Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me",,,,General
"Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!",,,,General
"I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...",,,,General
"I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.",,,,General Petite
"This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.",,,,General Petite
"Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s",,,,General
"I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.

unlike another reviewer, i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer. wi",,,,General
"I love this top. it is loose and comfortable. it is not sheer so you don't need a cami. it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit. 1 criticism, it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful.",,,,General Petite
I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear,,,,General Petite
"I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2"", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs",,,,General Petite
"I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted. i am 32c and the top was too big. fit perfectly on hips. the lace material means it cannot be easily altered, so i chose to return the dress. i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit.",,,,General
"The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it's come to that.",,,,General Petite
I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.,,,,General
"This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(",,,,General Petite
"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.

this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.

"The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it's so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ã¼ber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v",,,,General
"I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli",,,,General
"I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim",,,,General Petite
"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors",,,,General Petite
"I tried this on from the sale section, and they only had a 2 (i usually do 0), and surprisingly, that size was the right fit. it is fitted, with just enough room to eat :-)

"I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model, but if i was to tighten it, it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite), and it looked huge, when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work, it was a lot of fabric, and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall, so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look, this is great. i would, however, order eptite for 5'1.5"".

"I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!",,,,General Petite
"This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size.",,,,General Petite

"This shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was. i love the shape, design, and and the color. it's perfect for spring and summer with some white pants. unfortunately, i don't see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way. so far, it doesn't work with any of my jeans, skirts, or shorts. i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits, so i'm still on the fence if i'm going to keep it or not. with that aside, it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful",,,,General Petite

"I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.",,,,General Petite

Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.,,,,General
I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.,,,,General

"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.",,,,General
"The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.

I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh,,,,Initmates

"I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok, something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.",,,,General Petite
"Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.

great, versatile shirt.",,,,General
"I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers, it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt. i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length (with my height) and amount of material became overwhelming on me. it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well.",,,,General Petite
"Gorgeous top, very nice. detail work, soft and flattering. i don't think its too full on the bottom at all - mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette. word of warning: soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink - and definitely not my color. if peach isn't flattering on you, heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly! i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade, bummer that i thought the other reviewers might",,,,General
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.,,,,General

"Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11""!).",,,,General Petite

Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.,,,,General Petite
"This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least.",,,,General Petite

"This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer, or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight, it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage, but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses",,,,General

"I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin",,,,General

"This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.",,,,General

I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,,,,General Petite

"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!",,,,General Petite

This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.,,,,General Petite
"I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear, it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record, those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.",,,,General

"I walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friend's spring wedding, as a lot of this season's dresses are more casual, but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons: it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories, the fabric feels incredible, it has pockets, and it's really fun yet classy as heck. typically i wear a 10/m in dresses, but they only had a 12 in store, so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w",,,,General

i agree that the fabric is quite thin compared to what you may be used to with byron lars dresses, but the flattering fit and quality (has a nice built in slip) i found to be what you may expect from the brand. if you go in thinking it's more of a spring/summer dress, you will not be disappointed.

"This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back.",,,,General

This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,,,,General Petite
A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!,,,,General

This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.,,,,General Petite

"This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette, so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand, and",,,,General

"Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.",,,,General
Cute cute. simple tank with a little something to add interest.,,,,General
"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so, it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned.",,,,General
"Beautiful top, loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from
hanging at store or the way it was sewn.",,,,General Petite
"I ordered this in two colors, in my regular size. i washed and laid flat to dry....it shrunk like crazy. i held the one i washed up to the other unworn/unwashed one and it was at least two inches shorter. they may both be going back. i am so sad.",,,,General Petite
I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!,,,,General Petite
It is so simple but elegant and beautiful! i am 5'3 and 120 lb and extra small fits me perfectly,,,,General Petite
"I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.",,,,General Petite
"This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it.",,,,General

"I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!",,,,General
Love this shirt with leggings. if you are in between sizes- size down,,,,General Petite
Unusual color. expensive even on sale.,,,,General
"I am 5'4"" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron",,,,General Petite
"Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.",,,,General Petite
"I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up.",,,,General Petite
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.,,,,General Petite
"I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!",,,,General Petite

"Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too ""baggy"" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!",,,,General
"I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4"", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha",,,,General

"I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.",,,,General
Beautiful sweater but the material is a bit thinner than i was expecting. but it hangs nicely and the sleeves are nice and long!,,,,General Petite

"Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6"" and the size 6 is perfect for me.",,,,General Petite
"The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.",,,,General
"Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks.",,,,General Petite
"Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3"" shorter, considering alterations. i'm 5'7"" the model is 5'10"", so yeah 3"" shorter would be cute!",,,,General
Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.,,,,General Petite
"I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.",,,,General Petite
"This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.",,,,General Petite
"This is silly, but the moss is not brown as pictured but olive green. with that ""said,"" i am going more casual, and i love the ""flex"" of this coat. the shape is beautiful and the lining is fun. i waited two months to get this in close to my size 00. for my style it is a keeper, but this back order situation is not acceptable. don't know whose fault that is?",,,,General
"I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11"", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges.",,,,General Petite
"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s",,,,General
"I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size.",,,,General Petite

"I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.",,,,General Petite
"This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher, not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.",,,,General
"I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd.",,,,General
"I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l",,,,General
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.,,,,General Petite
I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!,,,,General Petite
"Ditto what the first reviewer said, unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar, i suspect, to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans",,,,General

"Love these pants. corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant. comfortable. not too stretchy. maintains shape, even with multiple wears between cleaning. pairs nicely with black, neutral, or buttery yellow tops. fun print. received compliments first time i wore them. sizing is just right also. i'm 5'3. usually wear 26 in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a 27p which fits me just fine.",,,,General Petite

"Got the small petite. length is perfect, love the color, super comfy, very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top, so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits, if not it's going back. i'm 5',",,,,General
"These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!",,,,General Petite
"These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.",,,,General Petite
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",,,,General
"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo.",,,,Initmates

This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.,,,,General

this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3"" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl",,,,General

"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.",,,,General

"I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!",,,,General
I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!,,,,General
This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it's flattering and looks great with jeans.,,,,General
"I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,",,,,General

"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6"" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",,,,General
"I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.",,,,General
"I've been looking for some new, casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8"", not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however, i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it, however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this",,,,General

"I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also, i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!",,,,General
"This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute, but better suited for someone smaller chested.",,,,General
I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!,,,,General

Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!,,,,General
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.,,,,General
"I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!",,,,General

"I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.",,,,General

I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.,,,,General

"L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.",,,,Initmates

I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy,,,,General Petite

Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!,,,,General
"I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3"" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future.",,,,General Petite
"This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down, as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!",,,,General Petite
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.,,,,General Petite
I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.,,,,General Petite
"I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!",,,,General
"Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.",,,,General Petite
"I love the idea, and color, very flattrering and easy to trhrow on, however, i need the petite in this one, and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing, and since it combines xs/s, it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough.",,,,General Petite
"I received this in the mail a few days ago, and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/12 in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking",,,,General Petite
"I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5"" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are",,,,General Petite
"Everyone has said it, so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great, soft, flattering top. i bought two, one in white and one in black, and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up, and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits. (i live in florida, and these tops make great beach cover ups). i am 5'7"" and over 160 but not busty, and the medium was swimming on me, but i think this particular shirt is supposed to be that way. su",,,,General Petite
"Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull.",,,,General
I love this shirt! it hides my tummy perfectly without being too baggy! super cute!!,,,,General
"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to",,,,General Petite
"The fabric is wonderful, flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7"", 145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch"", never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung",,,,General Petite
"I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.",,,,General
"I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-112 lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh",,,,General Petite
"Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9"" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.",,,,General
"This dress is great! it fits true to size and the pockets are very unnoticable!
my only note is that the first picture of the dress show the dress to be a bit darker than the actual dress. the dress colour more closely resembles that of the other two photos.",,,,General
"I'm very pale, and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin, though.",,,,General
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi,,,,General Petite
"I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.",,,,General
"This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)",,,,General
"This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!",,,,General
"Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.
this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!",,,,General
"Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!",,,,General
Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!,,,,General
"Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it, even from my teenage boys! runs large, but that's the style of it, very flowy. very flattering.",,,,General
"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering",,,,General
"Didn't work on this curvy gal.
sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass.",,,,General
"The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building, but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist, the loose fit at the hips, and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would",,,,General
"I am so happy i purchased this top in 2 colors while it was on sale. i have the navy/white pattern and the green. both are vibrant and fun. i'm 8 months pregnant and these fit me currently. i can see them being a great top for post baby and on as well. i'll probably layer this in the fall and winter with a chambray jacket or a loose knit sweater. my only complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the top button comes undone very easily. it also pulls a bit at the top 2 buttons, but i may be able to",,,,General
"I'm so short that this could be a dress! runs a little big, but very forgiving. the green color is so vibrant! love love love!",,,,General
"This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!
i would recommend this product",,,,General
"Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!",,,,General
Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.,,,,General
"This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments.",,,,General Petite
"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. 
retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.",,,,General
Like the extra details on the neck and back - and it's versatile to wear everywhere,,,,General
"Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.",,,,General
"This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. 

the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim.",,,,General
"This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore",,,,General
"I love swing tops. the more swingy, the better! this top is so fun. its a little hard to tell online, but its made of two fabrics. most of the fabric is a thin t-shirt material, and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric. its so so cool! the colors are just as they appear online, and the print is fun and edgy. i have larger arms, so i love the length of the sleeves. the other reviewer said it was cropped, but i did not have that experience. in fact i was able to wear mine w",,,,General
"I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 "" shorter in front (i am 5'8"") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person.",,,,General
"I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!",,,,General
"I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3""",,,,General
"I love this dress - originally ordered the medium, which is my normal size, especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping, and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model, and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect. 

i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price, this would have been nice.",,,,General
"This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.",,,,General
"Cute white t-shirt different style but didn't work on my body type so i returned it 
 good price point 
 basic fabric",,,,General
"Nice, flowy, comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest, despite the top fitting loosely on me, so i have to wear a layer under it.",,,,General
"I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday, i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly. 

i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely",,,,General
I absolutely love this shirt! even though it has a large flowy design it looks wonderful. the print is so unique and will transition to autumn beautifully! i loved it so much i got both colors.,,,,General
"I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust, otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3"" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that.",,,,General
"I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:
__________
pros:
- pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.
- the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course, i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.
- runs ""mostly"" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i",,,,General

"This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!",,,,General Petite
"I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on",,,,General

"....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.",,,,General
"This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!",,,,General

"I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.",,,,General

"I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me.",,,,General

"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.",,,,General

This top/jacket is less red than it appears in the pictures - more of a wine color (as it is labeled) but it is pretty and the gold details are nice.,,,,General
This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.,,,,General
I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!,,,,General
Beautiful color and a great lightweight piece for fall layering. the petite sizing was perfect for me. more like a belted kimono. very happy with this purchase,,,,General
It's really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric. i thought it would be more substantial. got lots of compliments .,,,,General
Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.,,,,General
"This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1"" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it",,,,General
"In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums, i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft, not too stiff or scratchy, and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece, i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter, too. yay!",,,,General

"This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size, but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down, i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out, which is no big deal, but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall, it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it.",,,,General
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.,,,,General
It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.,,,,General
"For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir",,,,General

"This is probably a blouse for curvy women. with that i mean large breasted. i am a 40d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office. the bottom is a little too large but not too long. however, the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesn't lose the shape. i am tempted to buy 2 more. if you are thin, you probably need to size down.",,,,General

I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.,,,,General
"Yep. this is snug, so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been",,,,General

I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.,,,,General
"Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however, this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size, but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model, and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....",,,,General
"I am reasonably petite, but i like sweaters very oversized and large, so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large, the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size, the sweater ended up looking very awkward, with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do",,,,General

"I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but, the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin",,,,General

"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else.

I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.,,,,General Petite

"I bought the design which has now sold out, of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but, it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.

this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.",,,,General
Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.,,,,General Petite
Bought this in green at my local store and fell in love with it! i also tried one in pink and it was a bit sheer which is why i opted for the green color instead. very nice and feminine.,,,,General
"Very cute dress but the skirt flares out more than it looks in the picture. this made my midsection look unflattering from the side. also, for some who is on the flat chested side, you need a good bra or alteration (at least for me). despite what i listed above, i kept the dress since it's a versatile dress for many occasions.",,,,General
"I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.",,,,General

"I'm a 32-a, and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight, but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back, it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it, but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.

"I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!",,,,General
"This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.",,,,General
"Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.",,,,General
"Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.",,,,General
"This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.",,,,Initmates
"I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall, i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...",,,,General
You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,,,,Initmates
"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.",,,,General
Great fit and design but the wool is too itchy and rough. will need a layer underneath,,,,General
"This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.",,,,General
"While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!",,,,Initmates
"Slighty fitted, flattering, very soft and not itchy. the orange is a very nice color.",,,,General
"I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.",,,,General

"I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not ""baggy"" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)",,,,General
I loved the color and the style of the sleeves.  it was a bit too short on me and i thought it made me look boxy so i didn't end up keeping it,,,,General
Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.,,,,General
This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.,,,,General
I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.,,,,General
"I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark",,,,General Petite
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.,,,,General
Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.,,,,General
"I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!",,,,General
Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.,,,,General
"I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.",,,,General
"I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear",,,,General

The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.,,,,General Petite
"Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3"") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!",,,,General
"I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body, straight up and down, i ordered 2 sizes down, but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter, not blue, and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair, but, for me, because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.",,,,General
This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!,,,,General Petite
"I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn",,,,General
Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.,,,,General
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it,,,,General
"I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the ""skirt"" is adorable.",,,,General
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid",,,,General
"This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms, and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket, but it's just too sloppy.",,,,General Petite
"I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos",,,,General
I love these pants so much i even paid full price for them.  i'm going to order them in navy too.  super cute fit.  cute with flats or heels.,,,,General
"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.",,,,General Petite
"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",,,,General Petite
"Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but i'm only 5'4"". i usually wear a size 12 or 32"" waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. i'm not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because i've had my eye on this for months:(",,,,General
"Absolutely beautiful - 
usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.",,,,General
Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.,,,,General
"Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat, even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!",,,,General
"Tried this on and loved it! chic, lightweight, warm, cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!",,,,General
"I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish, modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored, conservative, and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs, i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is ""blah"", average.

the material is textures and crinkly, not slick. the top is cream/ivory color",,,,General Petite
"I love this shirt! i was surprised by the other reviews. it's boxy, but not unflattering. i get so many compliments on this. a steal for the price.",,,,General Petite
"It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.",,,,General Petite
"I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over, and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top",,,,General
"This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.",,,,General Petite
"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",,,,General Petite
"Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in",,,,General
"I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside",,,,General Petite

This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.,,,,General
"Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.",,,,General
"Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2"", 115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this.",,,,General
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.,,,,General Petite

Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s,,,,General

I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.,,,,Initmates

Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.,,,,General
"Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.",,,,General
I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!,,,,General
"The quality of this vest is outstanding, and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days, in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style, but i am 5'1"", 100 lbs and i can carry it off.",,,,General
This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.,,,,General
"I love this skirt! it's a denim material, so it's structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didn't have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up.",,,,General Petite
Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.,,,,General Petite
"I fell for the charcoal one and bought standard size m/l. on first wearing with slim jeans, booties and a long sleeved t, the body of the vest was fine. but with wavy shoulder-length hair, i found the large, wide collar overwhelming at the top. i tried folding the collar under, as in the photo of the gray one, but still too much. i altered it by paring it down by 7 inches at the back neck, and tapering down to meet the lapel at mid-chest. the fabric looks like boiled wool, but is actually a tigh",,,,General

I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!,,,,General
Love this sweater. fun for fall. soft fabric and runs true to size. will look great with jeans or dress pants.,,,,General

pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.

"The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b, 150 5' 9"", tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric.",,,,General

colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove.

length on the petite was above the knee, like show",,,,General Petite
"This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size, it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).",,,,General

Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!,,,,General Petite
"This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it, which is awesome, and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also, the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.",,,,General Petite
"I love the unique design of this dress.  it also has a nice thick material.  the top part runs small.  i'm normally between size 6 and 8.  i bought this dress in size 10 and the top part is still snug, whilst size 12 is too loose.  the bottom part has a nice flowy material with pockets.  since the top part is snug, it will best not to wear a bra plus the thick material will provide a nice support.  the down side of this dress is that the straps are running long.  i have a short torso, so there's",,,,General Petite
"This top isn't so much on the hanger but very cute once you try it. the neckline is really cut low so a pin or stitch is necessary. the length on the regular is perfect for my shorter body. if you have a long torso it might not work for you. love how the layers conceal but do not overwhelm your body.  i purchased my regular size medium in black. for reference: 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd.",,,,General
Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.,,,,General Petite
The design on this dress is so cute. it runs really small. i had to go up from my normal size 4 to a 6. i am not well endowed so the top was great on me. it's looks great on once k got a size that works.,,,,General Petite

Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.,,,,General Petite
"I wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great! regrettably, i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me. i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room, would be swimming in a m. the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be. the color was just as shown and beautiful. hope it works for some of you out there",,,,General
"This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.",,,,General

Unexpected delight! great top that can be dressed up or down. the only con is a little small through the bust.,,,,General Petite

"The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. 
bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s",,,,General
"I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4"", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops).",,,,General
I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.,,,,General Petite
"So, so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!",,,,General Petite
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!",,,,General Petite
"I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!",,,,General Petite
Super cute and flattering!,,,,General Petite
"First, i love this top overall. it is simple and classic and has a flattering, forgiving cut. i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned. the v-neck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath. instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it, and that worked beautifully. i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together",,,,General
"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a",,,,General Petite

Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!,,,,General
I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.,,,,General Petite
I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!,,,,General Petite
This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.,,,,General
"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect! 
i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event.",,,,General Petite
"Just picked this up in black in the store. on the hanger it looks like just another v-neck tank, but it is quite flattering on. however, the v-neck is quite exaggerated and loose, i will be pinning it so it doesn't sag open. :)",,,,General

This is a nice lightweight summer top to wear with a pair of shorts. it is low cut though - lower than i expected so i wear a tank underneath it. the layers are flattering.,,,,General
"This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned.",,,,General
"I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi",,,,General Petite

"Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty""",,,,General
I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.,,,,General

I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!,,,,General

"It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i'm in europe so there aren't dryers... washed it in cold water, line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn't blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water",,,,General Petite

"I'm so excited about this dress! it's perfect for the summer. the material is so soft and lightweight, with a great lining. i ordered a small petite and it fits great! the ruching in the front isn't overdone, so you don't have to worry about adding bulk in the midsection. no problem with my bra (32dd) showing in the back either.",,,,General

I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.,,,,General Petite
"This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.",,,,General Petite

"These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem.",,,,General Petite

"As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!",,,,General Petite
"I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.",,,,General
"The first reviewer summed up many of my thoughts exactly. i don't like to go without a bra and this dress with its slightly wider, almost cap-sleeve straps solves my problem perfectly. i love this neckline and wish i'd see it in more maxi dresses! the crossover and cutouts in the back mimic the lines of a traditional indian sari blouse and skirt, again without sacrificing bra coverage. just a beautiful and inspired design - definitely a standout in the sea of summer maxi dresses i've seen. i lov",,,,General
"I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2"", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down.",,,,General
"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret",,,,General
"This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to wear with a bra. the back is great and the length is perfect for me. it's flattering, but the pattern (being light in color across the middle) isn't particularly flattering on your waist. that being said though, the gathering in front is great for hiding bumps and whatnot (after 3 kids that's important to me). lightweight and great for summer. 5'8"", 135lbs and the size s fit perfectly.",,,,General

"This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1"", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4"") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re",,,,General
"I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...",,,,General
"This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.",,,,General
"I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4"", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length.",,,,General
"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews, but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants, but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these.",,,,General
"This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant, beautiful pattern, the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me, so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color, it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!",,,,General
I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.,,,,General
"These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.

i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam.",,,,General Petite
"The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!",,,,General Petite
I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!,,,,General
"Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.",,,,Initmates
"I love these pants! comfortable, light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend. the color is a little more saturated in person, but can't really complain about that too much!",,,,General Petite
"I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small.",,,,General
"As a lazy one, i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big ""thank you"" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design, perfect fit and perfect material, soft, cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3"" ordered size",,,,General
"I am just over 5'8""and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso, almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition, they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame, they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.",,,,General Petite
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.,,,,General Petite
Love these pants. super light and great color. they are a bit long though,,,,General Petite
Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.,,,,General
"This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however, at about the mid-belly range, the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price, i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.",,,,General
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe",,,,General
This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt! i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts... and i'm glad i did! the fabric is the same cloth,,,,General
"Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.",,,,General
"I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.",,,,General
"These jeans are well-made, the cut is decently flattering, but on more muscular thighs, it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher. the petite on me was just below the ankle, so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long. if you are taller or have longer legs (mine are short on my short height), then i think these would be great. i dind't find them particularly small, but htey were snug (muscular thighs). overall, ok but returning them. (25 p ordered, 115 lbs, 26.5 in",,,,General
"Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store, and i will have to wear heels with the pants... or get them hemmed... the color choices are all great, i wanted navy, but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar, so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time, i will be grabbing those as well.

i went with 25, my typical size lately (115 lbs)",,,,General Petite
"I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them,. i exchanged for the next size up, because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store, i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.",,,,General

"I wanted so much to love this dress, but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it. the color of the dress (green) was lovely, and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much. i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large; but even at that size the dress was too large, especially around the hips (which, for someone with an hourglass figure, is saying a lot!). the extra fabric around the hips belled out some, making",,,,General
I love this dress!!! this is perfect for ladies with curves. it does run a little large and i felt i could have worn both the small and the medium. i bought medium because it accentuated my curves without being too revealing. i bought the dark green which is a beautiful color and not see through at all...although i can guess the white might show a little but the white was not available in my store. this will be so perfect for the cold weather.,,,,General
"Bought this for my brother's wedding and i just received it. i ordered my usual size xs. it's a tightly woven knit, with little to no stretch in it. i could barely get it over my head and my arms could barely fit in the sleeves. and i don't have big arms at all. for reference, i'm pushing 5'7"", around 125 lbs. i'm glad it's so structured because i was worried that it would lose it's shape with this material make-up. but, no. it's really fitted. alas, i need to try again with the next size up. ma",,,,General Petite
"I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it's quite thin. it isn't sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy.",,,,General
"Fabric is soft and comfy, color is true to photo. the arms are a little tight now and i haven't washed it yet so i am a bit worried but still a keeper.",,,,General
"As others have said, this dress does run large. i ordered the xxs petite, and ti isalmsot big on me (hips are wide, so at least, it is comfortable in width). material is a bit scratchier than i am used to s well.

color is great, and it looks nice when i see it on my stylist, who convinced me to hold on to it for a little... thinking about it.

my zipepr was also a little hard to work.

shorter than some other dresses...",,,,General
"I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!",,,,General Petite
"I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors.",,,,General
"This is a gorgeous dress that while it runs quite small ( i normally take a s or xs ). i had to exchange it for a medium. i am 5 4"" and it falls below the knee which is how i like my dresses. it is a gorgeous pattern of color which could be worn for 3 seasons. i look forward to wearing it for many special occasions.",,,,General Petite
,,,,General
"These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i",,,,General
"This is a very cute and warm dress. it is flattering, yet appropriate for work. but i had to send it back for two reasons. the zipper didn't work well. it just wouldn't zip without someone helping me and even then it was very difficult to zip. perhaps it was just the zipper on my dress?

the neck felt like it was strangling me was the other reason i sent it back. if i am not comfortable i will not end up wearing it, so even though i loved the style of it the pragmatics were lacking.",,,,General
"These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice, and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper, and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles, maybe. true to size. a little long, so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.",,,,General
"These are the second pair of paige jeans i have purchased, and i have not been disappointed! jeans are great for casual dress or a night out on the town. fit stays true even after first wash. wish i had a pair of these in every color.",,,,General
Wore this dress last weekend in nyc. wore it from lunch until late night drinks after dinner. walked for hours in the dress. comfortable but dressy.,,,,General
"I agree with the review above regarding the sizing of the dress being large. i am a pear shape so i was worried the small would be tight in the hips however, the dress as a whole seemed large and not overly shapely. i'm 5'8"" but i also thought the dress was an inch or so shorter than i would prefer for a winter/fall dress. the dress is a very dark forest green (not black). see the photo for the shaping of the dress - it shoes that, due to the material, it oddly bulges in certain regions rather t",,,,General
Material is too thin and quality is poor,,,,General
Looks much nicer in the photo. i expected a much higher quality fabric. this fabric truly felt cheap. i expected a nicer dress for the price. the fit was unflattering on me. sent it back,,,,General Petite
"The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through, just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.",,,,General
The shirt brings back the '60s look of appliquã©d patches on shirts. it is a quality piece with a bit of humor. the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable . it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks. fabric feels good on skin.,,,,General
"This dress is lovely. the colors seem a bit more muted than as reflected on model; otherwise, looks very similar to photo. it has a slimline style and is very flattering. the dress has a more casual appearance than as is reflected in the photo. its really more of a day dress than a special occasion dress, notwithstanding another reviewer's opinion to the contrary.

i ordered up a size due to reading other reviews. i found it to be a bit larger than i wanted so i washed and tumble dried it on low",,,,General Petite
"I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy, feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about 2 inches longer, i'm 5'5 and it hits at low thigh, i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.",,,,General
"Recently, i have been so wanting to get a lightwash denim jacket and i found the piece right here! i love that its cropped and so easy to wear. its not stiff at all and sized right. i got an xs my normal size and its so comfy and surprisingly soft. 
great find but just a bit pricey.. but probably bc its paige. too bad pilcrow couldn't have made something like this.",,,,General Petite
"Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses.
i found that colors are not as bright as pictured, overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight, not too heavy nor too light, it is not itchy, but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right, i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper, but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short, i had to pull them up t",,,,General Petite
"This dress does run a tad small. for me it was small across the chest and i did have to shimmy into it. i am 5'6"", 110 and got size s. if i had gotten the m it would have looked a tad frumpy (on me). pretty, but wasn't happy with the fit aside from that the ""line""separating the top from the bottom was rather high for me and it seems that it was not really intended to be an ""umpire"" waist. i tried a belt with it and at my natural waist left the line uncovered several inches up toward my chest. i",,,,General Petite
"This is a cute shirt, but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular ""flap."" it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason.",,,,General
"I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.

it runs quite large, in my opinion. i'm 5'7"" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light), but i don't think this is a problem, necessarily. had it been thicker, it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip",,,,General
"I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure, why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference, it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel, nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you, but not for me. back it went.",,,,General
"I got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review. however, when i tried it on, i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso - it fit great in the neck, arms and shoulders. and i didn't find the rest of the dress to be too roomy, although it wasn't a snug fit either. it came below the knee on me, but it didn't bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics. it is a little on the itchy side so, it may be best to wear a cami",,,,General
"Dress is comfortable, feels great and the fit exceeds flattery. the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute, fun but still classic detail that i didn't notice in the picture online. i love this dress and get so many compliments.",,,,General
,,,,General
"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.",,,,General
Love the easy fit of this dress. great for work or family events. love the ribbed sleeves and pockets are a plus!,,,,General
"So i now own three sparrow wool sweater dresses (shyle, bressay, this one). they all have the same problem...hips cut large/wide past the waist! everything from the waist up fits great. i'm not sure who they are using as a fit model, but she must be curvy in that j.lo way (which is nice but not my shape). i love the green color, the warmth, the neckline, and the easy fit. i will wear a coat to hide the body of the skirt. and do more squats",,,,General
"This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.",,,,General
Super cute version of your standard chambray shirt. i'll be adding more of my own patches to this one!,,,,General
"I am 5 '4"", 124lbs, and 36 c - usually take a small or sometimes a medium in t.la tops. this top seems to run particularly large as i ended up with an xs.",,,,General
"This was a really nice, soft lightweight sweater, perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem, it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price, but the color was really pretty and on sale, i would def. go for it. for reference, i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.",,,,General Petite
I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,,,,General Petite
"I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture. so soft, very good quality, fit perfectly. definitely worth it for this price!!!",,,,General Petite
"I ordered this top in my normal size medium, and it was very large. i am 160 lbs, 36b, size 8 top and 12 bottom. it was so pretty, that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it's pretty lightweight, but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck, but i am small on top, so it does not bother me. it's such a comfy yet sexy top!",,,,Initmates
"This dress has really great features--the style is adorable, and i love the color. the contrasting color straps are a nice feature. the only thing i don't like about it is that it's a rather thin material. not quite sure yet if i should wear it as a dress or simply as a swim cover-up.",,,,General Petite
Loved this sweater but too boxy,,,,General Petite
"I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer, i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6"" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.",,,,General Petite
"I love this sweater. the pale pink color is gorgeous. i ordered a large because i have broad shoulders, and it fits perfectly. it's a great sweater for any season. love the slits on the sides and the longer back. i would order more if it came in white or black. love it!",,,,General Petite
"Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!",,,,Initmates
"I agree with other reviewers that the material is pretty thin, and it would make a far better swimsuit cover-up or pajamas than an actual dress -- unless you don't mind that it is semi see-thru. however, that said, i do love it! it is soft, the cut on top is nice and the strappy back is pretty, and it is flattering -- as long as your tummy is fairly flat because it does hug your body as you move (so no bread and pasta). i have worn it a couple of times already, and i have received compliments on",,,,General Petite
"Wow. this is the perfect sweater. beautiful, soft color. lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons. it drapes beautifully. the knit is tight, no see through or snags. very soft and comfy. the casual, easy, pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style. am starting to love this designer. highly recommend.",,,,General Petite
"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t",,,,General Petite
This top is perfect. i absolutely love this sweater. it is super cute to wear with shirts for the summer and it will look just as cute with jeans for the fall/winter. the color is very subtle and not too pink. it is super soft and i would 100% recommend this to someone!,,,,General Petite
"Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin, so it works as a swim cover, but definitely not a dress for anything else.",,,,General Petite
"Would have loved this skirt, but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!",,,,General Petite
"Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful. also, 100% cotton (yay! i hate poly)! thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer. so unless you're skinny, you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff.",,,,Initmates
"I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ",,,,General Petite
"This top is so cute. i don't usually like crochet tops, but when i saw this i just had to order it, so glad i did! my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke, but that can be fixed.",,,,General
"Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top.",,,,General
"Although the fabric and color is beautiful,  the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.",,,,General
"Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy, hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!",,,,General
"This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace, substantial fabric, great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders, and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model, they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned, the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs, and tried a size s.",,,,General
"I saw this top online and ordered immediately!
i loved the color, lace, and unique details.
sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!
the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly, and is very rough against your skin.
the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way.,.....
that although i am so in love with this color, i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.
it could have been fantastic, if the lace was softer, and some a",,,,General
"Just got this skirt in the mail today and overall i'm happy with it and will keep it. i was disappointed that the color is not really plum in person as it looks in the pictures. it's more of an ambiguous color somewhere between brown/gray/plum. the fit is good, the quality is good, although the skirt is a little longer than i would like (and i ordered the petite size). it's not really a mini skirt, just an above the knee skirt on me. i'll take it to my tailor and have him take it up an inch and",,,,General Petite
The material is soft. it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans.,,,,General Petite
"Very nice casual corduroy skirt for the fall. it sits nicely at the waist and the asymmetrical cut gives it some visual interest. it has a slightly a-line shape and the side seams round up a couple of inches. i took a point off for it not being lined, and the closure relies on the zipper alone instead of having a hook along with the zipper. i took my usual small and like how it fits. my only concern is that it is a little on the short side for me but since it's a fall skirt and will always be wo",,,,General Petite
"Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online, but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one.",,,,General
"I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.

rolls are not sewn on both ends, so you'll have to re-roll each wash.

wish you carried these basics at all times.",,,,General Petite
The color of this top is amazing--much more vibrant than in the photo and the fit is perfect. it is very flirty and pretty and the detailing around the top is gorgeous. it's pricey but i splurged and am glad i did. it looks adorable with a corduroy skirt and boots for the fall.,,,,General
T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.,,,,General
My new favorite socks! has a grip and doesn't slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet. perfect for my low boots.,,,,Initmates
Love the color and length of these shorts! i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cut-offs and these pilcro shorts are winning! fit great like all pilcro denim and i'm sure i will be getting a lot of wear (i.e. every day) out of these shorts.,,,,General Petite
"This is a nice looking skirt. the corduroy has a little sheen to it. looks cute with a sweater, tights and boots. length is slightly longer on me than the model in the photo. there are small slits at the side seams and the hem is curved at the slits.",,,,General Petite
Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.,,,,General Petite
"I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white, yellow, pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.",,,,General Petite
"This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.",,,,General
"I love the cut and ""swing"" of this tee. the royal blue is very saturated and pretty.",,,,General Petite
"I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale, too. thoughts below:
______
pros:
- it is well made and on the thicker side. 
- for a peplum, it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips, which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo",,,,General
"I love everything about this jacket so much that i had to buy three colors (grey/rust/teal). not only is it figure flattering, it's warm, water repellent, easily layered and well made. the little pop of color contrast added to the stripe seam makes it unique. i would say sizing is tts to a bit large. the only thing that would improve the coat is better finishing of the hems.",,,,General
"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!",,,,General
I was looking for a good navy top for the spring/summer to wear with white denim for a nautical look. this top is perfect and i especially like the neck for when its cooler in the evenings.,,,,General
"This brand always makes the softest tees, and so i buy several each season. when i saw this one online, i worried that it might be too long for my short waist, but i decided to order it anyway. success! i ordered my usual size m (for knit tops - 10/12 in fitted ones), and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the side.
fyi: short waist, broad shoulders/back, 36c - i carry my weight in the middle, since i virtually do not have a waistline. so a longer, boxy tee will emphasize the parts of",,,,General
"I really like this skirt. it is soft and the length is just right. i hate skirts that go below the knee. the only thing i don't care for is that there seems to be extra fabric in the back... maybe i should had ordered a size down. and the skirt does wrinkle easily. still, not enough reasons to send back. i have had many compliments at work.",,,,General Petite

pros:
- flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps.
- cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly.
- little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel.
- good overall length.
- usa made!

"I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn't realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also, the fit is loose, maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress.",,,,General

"This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear, really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4"", i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft, flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!",,,,General

"I was hoping this dress was a bit thicker, but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer. because of the body skimming design, this dress likely won't work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery. if you work out and are very fit, you might like it, but i don't so i'm not that brave! lol",,,,General
I took a chance buying online. i'm thrilled this dress clings at the top and releases where it should (below the bust) without looking like a tent. a very classy dress for work or play. just hope it holds up after a wash as the material is thin (but opaque). love this dress.,,,,General

"I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room, the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well. 

i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co",,,,General

"In general, if you were a fan of the turtleneck swing dress, you'll love the overall fit (tts) and fabric of this. the patterns/colors are also great! my issue was the armholes...they are a bit too large and the opening comes a little too far forward which makes it a little unflattering in the underarm area. i may reconsider when it goes on sale, but it's a pass for now.",,,,General Petite

"Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green, so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes, the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6, and this one the 8 fit perfectly, so maybe one size up.",,,,General Petite
"Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle, comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w",,,,General
"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger, so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy, 5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving, fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models, or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!",,,,General

I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.,,,,General Petite
"Love this dress - ""swingy"" is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down.",,,,General
"I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version, but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale. 

i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.",,,,General

"I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o",,,,General

"I love this dress! the design is simple, colors and patterns are eye-catching but not over the top. cutting is perfect for me and very flattering. the material is flowy not clingy. it is a piece of easy, no-hassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform. seriously, it doesn't get better than that. if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns, i will just buy them blindly.

"This dress is adorable. i got it in red and it is very flattering. i love the shape - it has a slight flare without being too full. the fabric is firm so it holds a nice shape, and there is a stretchy material lining on the inside that make it very comfortable. my only complaint, and why i didn't give it a 5 star rating, is that the zipper sticks at the ribbon junctions. a bit frustrating, but not enough that i won't keep the dress.",,,,General Petite

"First, i absolutely love this dress, and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended, and the dress fits perfectly. however, when i zipped the dress up, the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly, so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.",,,,General

"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",,,,General Petite

"Usually a m, ordered a s and sp. the sp fit well. comfortable/flattering. fit note: picture makes it look like nude lining is a lot shorter, it is not - this was true in both sizes. great holiday/nye party dress. i disagree fabric feels cheap, but hem off pattern/not even. worth it on sale but not full price.",,,,General
"This dress runs large!
i tried on a large, then a medium and then a small! couldn't believe i fit a small! this is a cool, breezy summer ensemble that you can wear anywhere! dress it up or down, it's comfy and makes you feel like you can breathe under its baggy motif. love it!!",,,,General Petite
"The moment i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. the plaid is beautiful with tones of red, blue and periwinkle. the photos on the website are very true. the unexpected pockets make it even cuter. i also got the sandals as pictured because i love the whole look. i an 5'5"" and usually wear a 4 or 6. i got the small and then wondered if it were too big. i ended up going back and trying on the extra small, but it turns out the small was correct. it should hang and drape and it not meant to be f",,,,General Petite
"I love this sweater. it's heavy, with a rich texture that feels like very cool grandma. the cut is straight, and the collar feels natural. a small wraps closed across my chest (usually a s/4/6) without being baggy. falls to my mid-calf at 5'6"".",,,,General
This dress was exactly what i wanted. great material. cute pale blue slip lining the dress. i ordered a medium and it was perfect. i am about 5'6 and about 145. i received compliments all day on how cute it was,,,,General Petite
There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.,,,,General
"Love just know the embroidery is navy blue wearing them today, size down",,,,General
I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!,,,,General
"This dress looks way better than pictured online. it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight (not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items i've purchased before) and lays great! i purchased a size small, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and thought it was true to size, i can't wait to wear this! warm weather, sandals and a tote for running errands!",,,,General
"I really loved the fabric of this dress, however, it had a weird fit and the pockets made the front hang funny.",,,,General
"I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching, adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful, i am 5'7"", 133, and a 36a. 
if you have been considering this dress, don't delay, especially at the wonderful sale price!",,,,General Petite

"I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi",,,,General
"Man do i love this dress! love the fit and the quality of the fabric, lays really nicely. i gave it only four stars because it is super short. true i am 5'11"" but there is no way i could wear this without pants or leggings. i am super bummed because i really love it but must send it back.",,,,General
"I love these jeans! when i saw them in my retailer store, i instantly fell in love. they fit like a dream and they look so much better in person than online. they're definitely a boyfriend fit, so if you're between sizes, go down a size. i've already gotten tons of compliments!",,,,General
"These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes, even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them!",,,,General
"I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip, however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type, especially in a madras plaid.",,,,General Petite
"I'm 5'7 and 137 pounds and i tried on this dress in the store. i got the small as it has a little more material in the medium and the small fits like a glove. this dress is great quality and feels good, looks good and can be dressed up or down. like the model in the picture i like the flats with this dress. high quality fashion and total comfort on a hot summer day. go anywhere with this dress and you look like a million dollars. one more little hidden detail it has a detachable slip underneath",,,,General Petite
"I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod",,,,General
"These jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding. would have perferred colorful embroiding though. they are boyfriend cut, but not slouchy. just a bit loose even around athletic legs. they run true to size, but have a lot of give. after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit. if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size.",,,,General
"I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price. to my amazement, it has become one of my go-to dresses. it is far more handsome and flattering in person. i ordered a m for my 5'9"" and 36c frame and the fit is perfect. contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model, the back is not straight, but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal. at this price, it's a no-brainier purchase.",,,,General Petite
"If they still have your size, grab it. fits a bit snug in chest, but material is light and airy. got so many compliments on it. great style",,,,General Petite
Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.,,,,General
"I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders, armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh",,,,General Petite
"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#.",,,,General Petite

Love it! perfect casual look with a jacket and booties,,,,General
I fell in love with this dress immediately. gorgeous print and colors. light and breezy. classic and comfortable. the petite length is perfect for my height and hits a few inches above the knee. i have a small bust (34a) but a wider rib cage so the petite small was a perfect fit. couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.,,,,General Petite
Love this dress so much. it's super comfortable and i always get a ton of compliments every time i wear it. the fabric is the perfect weight not too heavy. i'll be wearing this all summer long.,,,,General
"I love this dress. i don't have many pink things but saw someone in this on instagram and had to have it. it is as comfy as a nightgown. it has pockets! i tried it with brown sandals as well as with a dark jean jacket and taggart grey booties and looks cute both ways. also looks great with a blingy necklace. tts- got my normal med and it's roomy, but not too big.",,,,General Petite

"Gorgeous dress. it was designed to accentuate a woman's figure. lovely material, holds everything in place without being too revealing. the dress does not lose its shape. definitely a head turner",,,,General Petite
"I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.",,,,General
"The waist is a little high and large, and this causes gapping in the small-of-the-back area. very cute dress, if it fit well. would probably work on someone less curvy. 00p, 5'4'',110lbs,32c for reference.",,,,General
"This is one of the best purchases f
i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.",,,,General
I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!,,,,General
This top fits well as expected for the size. i love the ease of the top and wear it both casually and a bit more dressed up. great styling on the back.,,,,General
"I bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements. it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy. i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots. the red is really more of a bight pink color, not a rich red as pictured. i wish it came in more colors and patterns...maybe green or purple? it does run big, i usually take a large, but a medium was perfect.",,,,General

"I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.",,,,General
"Love this top. it's everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn't white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.",,,,General
"Nice lines, just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders.",,,,General
"I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.",,,,General
"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.",,,,General
,,,,General
"The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height,t eh other was so low, i could barely put my hand in it. however, the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice, but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs, but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size, so i let it go... (looked nice with pinched fabric in the back.

for reference i am 115 lbs, 30 dd< 26.5 in waist.",,,,Initmates
"I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model. but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews. well i must say, i'm so glad i did! i really love the shape of this dress. i'm heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist. the dress is very well made. if you order the right size for you, the slip dress will stay in place. i'm going to style it with high black platform heels, but i also like it with boots as",,,,General Petite
There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.,,,,General Petite
"For once, the dress looks better on me than on the model. mine is tight above the bow and black/grey. my bow isn't this big?not pulled so much and maybe it's not knotted in the photo. it's heavy canvas and doesn't show my flaws. i'm saving it for summer?can't imagine wearing it as a jumper as in the photo.

for me (5'3"", 32e, 125 lbs) the bust is slightly tight in a 6 but the shoulders are a bit wide in an 8, but both look good. mine is not petite and hits me above the knee (6).

the dress is co",,,,General
I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.,,,,General
"This top is really cute and can be worn off shoulder or not.  the embroidery is really pretty.  my only comment would be the top is shorter than i expected, if you wear it off shoulder its of course longer but still shorter than i would have preferred.  keeping it anyways as it will be a fun going out casual top.",,,,General
"This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off, and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.",,,,General
Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit. love the tiny buttons and the 3/4 sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me. already my favorite fall top.,,,,General
"I was a little hesitant to order this, thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up, ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and went with the size 4 regular",,,,General
"I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!
unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!",,,,General
"I love good, flowy blouses and like the over sized look, but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it, but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on, because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.",,,,General
"Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress",,,,General Petite
"This shirt is very soft and fits nicely. as with a lot of maeve tops, the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms you'll definitely want to size up. it won't make the shirt too ""blousey"" because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt. i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely!",,,,General
I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,,,,General
"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.",,,,General
The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.,,,,General
My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top.  i typically have issues with button-downs in the chest area (buttons never lay flat) and this top lays perfectly.  the material is super soft.  looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open.  i can't wait to wear with a pair of black high-waisted jeans this fall!,,,,General
"This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno",,,,General Petite

Love this dress! it's exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty. will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back. nice too that it has a detachable slip.,,,,General Petite
"I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up. i'm so glad i didn't because it ended up looking so much better on. i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs. i'm 5'6"" and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside. i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top, while pretty, had too much pink in it for me.",,,,General
"This shirt has an incredible softness to it and the purple print is so lovely, i did end up returning it simply because the flowiness was a bit too much for me. i had tried the 2 and 4 and went with the 4 due to arm restrictions in the smaller size. too bad because it really is a lovely top. definitely worth a try in store!",,,,General
"These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should. they do not pinch, bind, or ride up. they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra. i am very pleased with this purchase.",,,,Initmates
"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.",,,,General
This shirt is wonderful! i love the styling and the print. sure to be a favorite!,,,,General
"I got the dark blue print which is a really pretty pattern. the fabric has a nice crinkly feel and the cut is very forgiving. i thought from the pictures it would be more of a traditional button down with straight lines. it actually is a looser fit but without the trapeze shape of some ""swing"" tops which i have found to be less flattering for those of us who are curvier on the bottom half. it's comfortable and flattering, could be tucked in or worn out and likewise dressed up or worn casually wi",,,,General

"This is a super comfy and adorable shirt. got the black motif - it could def. be passed off as a dark/inkish navy color, too, so it's very versatile. it runs typical/tts for maeve (if you're unfamiliar with the brand, order up one or two sizes if you have broad shoulders and/or large arms). this is super lightweight; feels ""slinky"" for lack of a better word. essentially, it's rayon-gauze- but it is double-layered, so it is not sheer at all (no need for a cami, although in the lighter version i c",,,,General
"I really wish i could keep this top. the material is okay and i have noticed with this brand, shirts made from this material do not wash well or look that nice after a wash. if you have the time to dry clean then i would 100% recommend this top. another tip if you buy this (since i didn't read the description) the top has buttons all down the front. i am not a fan of button tops because i have a larger chest so i wouldn't recommend this top to someone who is busty.",,,,General Petite
"A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure, this isn't always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.
i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta, but definitely needed a large.
i ordered the ""lavender"" color, which is disappointing; a dull gray. i've decided to return and order the coral instead.",,,,General
I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.,,,,General
"I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn't buy too small, and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.",,,,General
"I bought the black motif, the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful, but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos, but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!",,,,General

"Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.",,,,General
I think this jumpsuit is different! the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft. the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well.  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just can't picture this worn to other outings.  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase.,,,,Initmates
"I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8, my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.",,,,General

I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isn't as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...,,,,General

"Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but i'm lucky to have purchased on sale.",,,,General
I love this top! the length is just right and i love the flow of it!,,,,General
"Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try",,,,General
"I usually wear a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised the xs fit better than the s. very pretty, really perfect color for fall. i like that it's not tight or constricting so you can wear it for every day and not feel like it's difficult to move around. the longer length is nice too for. bonus that it's not dry clean only. my only problem with this dress is it's all polyester, which is just cheap fabric. if it wasn't for that, i'd give it 5 stars.",,,,General Petite

I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing,,,,General

"This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said ""wow that's very elegant"". it is very soft. thin but warm. however, it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality",,,,General

"I absolutely love this top! i often shop the sale items first, but when i saw this top in the store, i didn't hesitate to pay full price. the material reminds me of vintage clothing - it is a dry clean only item, but is so special that it's worth it. the colors and construction (beautifully lined, bias trim) are impressive. and, this top looks better on me than on the model:)",,,,General Petite

I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,,,,General

"The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below:

pros:
- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.
- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.
- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.

I was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment. it is absolutely huge! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me. too bad cause it's such a pretty top. p.s. this has an attached camis (which i hate).,,,,General

After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo,,,,General Petite

i took the dress to my retailer store, and they were able to steam some of the wrinkles out, but not all of them. it seems that the fabric used for the ruffles is suppose to be a little crinkly. but it will most likely look worse after you sit. therefore, i am uncertain",,,,General Petite

This top turned out to be better than expected! i'm a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all. the embroidery details are lovely too. i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white. one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder. it looks just great with the sleeves up.,,,,General

"Beautiful dress, can be dressed up or down. runs just a bit large, but if i had sized down it would have been too tight in the bust (38d). i normally wear a medium and the medium was perfect in the chest. the color is absolutely gorgeous and i love the length - i don't like dresses that show my knees. my only complaint is that a dress that is this expensive even on sale should have better quality control. mine made it to me without a button at the the back. not a huge deal, but it won't be easy",,,,General

"I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color, which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.",,,,General

I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.,,,,General
"I saw this dress in the store and was drawn to the pattern as an alternative to my normal lbd. it looked okay on the hanger, but when i tried it on...wow! so pretty and chic. it actually hangs a little lower in the front on me than on the model pictured which adds to the chicness and makes it a sophisticated take on a kimono. (my husband's words) i wore it out that evening to dinner and received several compliments. i did not have any issues with fit. i am a size 6 and purchased a size 6. it fit",,,,General
"It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester, slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.",,,,General Petite

"This is an attractive, fitted vest. the tight belt on the back gives it a new look, great shape. the fabric is good quality. the neck is tight and high. i usually get a small at retailer, but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest. judging from the photo, i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium. it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans",,,,General
"I am a curvy girl with boobs! this dress was perfect. it hugged in all the right places and had room for my bust! i did go up a size...however, i normally have to do that anyway for the top to fit.

"This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.",,,,General

the front peek-a-boo cut outs really make them a delight to wear & show off some skin!

The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,,,,General

great color, versatile (i.e. work, weekend). fun accent piece to shield yourself from a brisk wind, while maintaining full fashion status. 
my first day wearing and i've rec'd many compliments. love the combo of trench coat and poncho. my one issue...i wish the sleeve strap actually buckled, it keeps slipping out of the faux buckle and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it. i usually wear a medium/size 10, but medium was sold out, so i ordered",,,,General Petite

"I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length, which does not work with my mama belly.",,,,General Petite

There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,,,,General
"I love this designer and decided to give this one a try. i ordered size large in black. it's a nice weight knit but not too heavy. good for fall and winter. the color is an intense,  saturated black that's really sharp looking. i thought it split up both sides, however, it's only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side, which isn't split and is shorter.  i carry weight in my midsection, and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way. i like t",,,,General
"Super cute. cotton is substantial enough not to show bra lines, but light enough to be summery & breezy. i misread ""xs"" and tried it on, thinking it was a medium, & oddly there's barely any difference among the xs, s, and m sizes--the buttons didn't even buckle out across my bust on the smaller sizes--so, this top could be a nice ego boost if you want to size down (i got the m anyway). armholes not too big, ruffle hides any tummy flaws. great with jeans, shorts, and skirts--like a perfect white",,,,General Petite

"Finally, a white top that does not show every nook and cranny. this is a great fabric. many times white shirts are see thru and i won't buy them. this top is lightweight but has enough substance to cover everything. the online picture does not do it justice.

the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.

as a whole, this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material",,,,General
Wasn't sure about this but got the xs/s on sale. the style is very wide and is longer on me than pictured. somehow it works because it drapes nicely from my shoulders. should be comfy to wear in the summer. the two i received are a deep turquoise and will pair nicely with some of my favorite jewelry.,,,,General Petite

This dress is a zillion times cuter in real life. it's very retro-swingy and girlish- it reminds me of something mia farrow would've worn in her rosemary's baby era. i have the black version and i've paired mine with tall black gladiator sandals for a more sultry nighttime look and also flip flops for beachy summer days. i think it's a total steal at the sale price.,,,,General Petite

"I ordered this in the mauve and it's a really pretty lilac color. unfortunately, the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it. my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area, but goes downhill from there. the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front. based on the model picture, i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front. it's also very long. completely covers my butt in the back and then some. could of been a beautiful tank",,,,General

The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,,,,General
I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.,,,,General
"This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.",,,,General

the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.",,,,General
"Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%, which you don't see often anymore!), great length, nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch, but as someone with a small waist and wider hips, i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure, these might work better",,,,General
Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!,,,,General

"Wasn't expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it's very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it's on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels, as another reviewer suggested. i'm 5'3"" petite. so, it doesn't swallow me",,,,General

"I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something, they do not hang or move well on the body. also, they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly, these are going back.",,,,General

"I saw this and the ""giddy up"" tees at the store, and it was so difficult to decide because they have their own uniqueness. unlike the giddy up tee, this tee has no embroidery, but saying it has just patterns is underestimating it. the pattern is a work of art, it has cowboys, ranch scenery, cacti, and the earthly colors are gorgeous for all seasons (especially for those who still have a leftover summer tan). the hem of the tee is a bit round which i thought is unique and versatile for tucking in",,,,General

I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.,,,,General
Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!,,,,General
"I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"", weigh 134 lbs, and do typically wear size medium.",,,,General
I bought this tee in purple. went back the next day and purchased the peach! this is a classic tee with a girly twist! cute with jeans and a jean jacket!,,,,General
I love this duster. it's really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.,,,,General
"I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)",,,,General
"I saw this tee and was unsure about the print, but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did, as it has become a weekend staple.",,,,General
"Runs a little small, but is very chic!!! you can wear it with jeans and a white t-shirt and you are going to look awesome!!!",,,,General Petite
"I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9"" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size.",,,,General
,,,,General
"I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy, and is a bit warm for indoors, but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10"". usually a small, but sized up to a medium with this one.",,,,General Petite
"I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.",,,,General Petite
The blouse is as shown in the picture. it falls nicely and is flattering to wear. the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality. i've received a lot of compliments on this top.,,,,General Petite
I bought this shirt in a size small. it fits the same as it does on the model. it's a comfortable cute shirt. wish the other colors were available because i'd order another one.,,,,General
Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.,,,,General
This product is amazing. i love that it's comfortable and stylish at the same time. i love the unique color pattern and the length of this product. i also love that i can wear to any occasion and can dress it up or dress it down. it's very versatile and i love it.,,,,General
"I tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasn't sure how much i'd wear it for the price. i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale. i think i prefered the subtlety of the pink/blush color. the maize is a goldenrod yellow, not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture. i'll still keep it because it is super comfy, though the sequins don't show as well as on the blush. it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels. i didn't find it to",,,,General
"And lovely color, just not on my pale skin hue unfortunately. i tried on the xs in store, and that was a little long on me, so i would need petite. the cut was very flattering, and super feminine, i love the color and pattern on the dr4ess too. sadly, not for me, i looked sick in it. (115 lbs, 30 dd and xs petite would fit)",,,,General

"This top was very pretty when i got it, but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice, and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine.",,,,General
"Ordered this in the white/gray. likely one of the softest tops i own, and drapes beautifully. density of fabric enough that i won't need a tee underneath. design of the pointed front will look great with a shorter jacket. i'm busty and there is a ton of fabric in the front. due to shipping i won't return but could have gone a size down, and i'm a 42dd.",,,,General

"I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering, lightweight, gorgeous color, cool raw edges, v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top, but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.",,,,General
"Fit is okay, the style of the shirt and the purple flowers are beautiful!",,,,General
Ordered this with my bday discount - the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs. i literally could not even get my arm in the xs! tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received - so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent,,,,General Petite
"Cute print on both sides, but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy, but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top, so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.",,,,Initmates
"Loved this as soon as i saw it. definitely darker than the photo; not as muted. since it was a jacket and i'd be wearing something under it, i chose a medium rather than the small i generally wear. the shoulders just fit and the rest was big making me look large. not a flattering fit and a major disappointment. nice that it works for the other reviewers but not for me. sadly, going back. the sweater shown underneath also runs loose and large so i'm exchanging that one for a small.",,,,General Petite
"Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft, cute design but not flattering. returning",,,,General
"Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.",,,,General Petite
"I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine, the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.",,,,General
Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t,,,,General
"Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered,' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft, true fit, and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'",,,,General
"Nicer twist on the casual tshirt. soft, comfy. love the purple.",,,,General
"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. 
touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt. 
although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything. 
just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.",,,,General
I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it's very comfortable and light.,,,,General
"This dress is happy! it is easy to wear and it is lined. it came in the mail super wrinkled tho. i went for the color more than the style and while the style is lovely, i fell in love with another retailer dress in the same color so i may return this.",,,,General
,,,,General
"This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however, when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition, though i ordered a size medium, it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad, i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are, go for it, but get a size smaller than you normally would!",,,,General
"This dress was overall cute, but you have to have an olive/darker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink. i'm very fare, but normally can do light punks, but this one just clashed. it does run pretty true to size. if you're on the edge between a smaller or bigger size, i recommend the smaller size however. hope this helps y'all!",,,,General

This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!,,,,General Petite
"I found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect. i got the size small which had plenty of space for me, usually a 4-6 or small (34a-28-26).
it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6"").
if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.
it has pockets too btw :)
this will be worn over everything this summer, let's hope the poly/rayon/spandex blend washes ok!",,,,General
I've been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting. i'm between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and it's just a little roomy so it's perfect. fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it won't be too warm.,,,,General
"I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear. i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant, sophisticated, and flirty all at the same time. a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention; stretchy, form fitting, sexy sheer upper and front back panel, you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress, the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side. it is true to size.",,,,General Petite
"I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.",,,,General
"When i saw this jacket in store, i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",,,,General Petite
"Just a warning, the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal, so as soon as i saw that, the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures, to me, it cheapens the whole dress, which would otherwise be adorable.",,,,General
I like this shirt and think its very feminine.,,,,General
"I am wearing a medium in the photos, my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference.",,,,General
"This top is true to size, although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin, i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v, but haven't tried it yet, let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium...",,,,General
"I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium
i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks.

"Absolutely gorgeous.  i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted.  all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo. i'm 5'6 and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges, so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual.  i range from 14-16/ l-xl in retailer dresses.  the size is dictated by my broad shoulders. since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and it's perfect.  the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable. the slip is als",,,,General
"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!",,,,General

Tts and comfortable. this t shirt brings flair to everyday wear and i purchased on sale for a steal!,,,,General
"This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens, but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me, it all felt more cloying than clever.

the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i",,,,General Petite

I purchased this dress in pink. it is absolutely beautiful. the shimmery detail around the neck is gorgeous! it is so flattering and looks amazing with boots or sandals! this dress will not disappoint!!,,,,General
"Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun, not too flashy. a very warm hue, it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material, very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made, with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress, and the small fit beautifully, even with my large top. it is a stunner, that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments",,,,General

"I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it's an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it's so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn't be worn in public. there's a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn't do much. pass, ladies.",,,,General
Cute but classy top because of the embroidery at the bottom!,,,,General Petite

"This duster is a nice light weight dark navy that you can throw on to add a little something to a your outfit without adding bulk or warmth. looks nice over dress, jeans, crops. just a fun little item to have in you closet that you can grab to put a little twist to an outfit. best part of the duster....it has pockets!! i love being able to slide my iphone into a pocket while on the go!",,,,General

"I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size, but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy, just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last, but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!",,,,General

colors are actually great, i don't know why people have issues ""matching"" - black or navy are equally neutral in my books...

This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.,,,,Initmates
"Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.",,,,General
"I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me. i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on. i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between, and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large. really it just depends on how you want it to fit. the length is great too, about 3 inches above my knee, i'm 5 foot 5, which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit. i got the",,,,General

I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!,,,,General

will be lightweight for our hot, humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.

Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit. the length was perfect for my 5'9 height. they are flattering very nice quality.,,,,General Petite
They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.,,,,General Petite
"These wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering; i'm 6' and 160, which translates into curvy territory. i didn't need extra length, and the size 32 was bigger than i need, but not too big. these are very classy looking, and go with sandals to booties for every type of look, summer to winter,  with a breezy top or a cozy sweater.  
the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down: those cuts are not the most flattering for most people. these jeans are smart but trendy;",,,,General Petite
"This is like wearing an afghan, but i get cold really easy so for me that's a good thing. and it's super soft and not itchy. i could easily never take this off. runs a little large, but that should be fine when it gets layered. ...only thing i didn't like was the one long stitch that holds the wrap in place. i worry it will snap and the whole thing will unravel.",,,,General Petite

"I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe, especially when paired with a dressier top, blazer, skinny belt and heels. also, i like that the jeans don't have the to",,,,General Petite
"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(",,,,General Petite

"This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large. 
definitely recommend.",,,,General
"The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter, but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd), however, i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also, the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit",,,,General Petite
"Really beautiful top. i agree with the others, a bit on the short side. it is cut a little wide but has a nice flow. the color is not pink. it is a blush type color that can be hard to wear for some skin tones, but i'm going to make it work because the top is too pretty to pass up.",,,,General Petite
"Boxy, short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...",,,,General Petite
"......not for the long waisted. i immediately ordered this top when i saw it online. the embroidery is beuatiful (although it will require extra care). the soft lavendar color was a breathe of fresh air. however, i felt like i was wearing a maternity top as it hung oddly on my slim, 5'9"" frame. i am long waisted so perhaps petites will find this top works for them. i agree with the other reviewer that indicated the arm openings are a bit large and deep. sadly, this one went back....",,,,General Petite
"This blouse does have a flowy, boxy shape to it but the details make up for that. when i wear it tucked into a skirt it looks wonderfully flattering. i tried on an xs and considered looking for a xxs but i feel that size would probably end up being too short instead of more fitted.",,,,General Petite
"I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side, but on my 5'7"" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!",,,,General Petite
"Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale, but not before that.",,,,General Petite

"This top is gorgeous in person! i got the small because at 5'5"", 127 pounds and a 30f chest, you never know how a top will fit. however, this one is big. i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out. i'll be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and there's a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse. love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it!",,,,General Petite

"I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store. i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top. i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model. i like the fact that it is a bit longer, it helps cover up some of my extra assets. the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it. i should have purchased the xxs online, it would",,,,General Petite
"I got this top in the ""brown"" color, although it is really more of a burnt rose, or light sienna shade and it is just lovely. i love the color. the fit is just right, comfortable and a good length. it feels very well-made and has beautiful details from the pleated collar/neckline to the slightly sheer upper back panel. i have only one tiny issue with this top: in the very front where it buttons, there is no lining or fabric behind the crocheted lace panels. in retrospect, i can see this slightly",,,,General Petite
"The detail on this top is beautiful, love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad, but it is much too wide, bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is, another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides, because the top does not lay like that. it runs large, especially under the arms. too bad......",,,,General Petite
"I tried on a small, but usually am xs:

this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't",,,,General Petite
"I just ordered this top and so far really like it, it is pretty and feminine and comfortable. the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through, unlike the lace to each side. it's not extremely noticeable, but i am planning on wearing a cami under it. i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side, i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me, but i'm fairly tall so i went with the small.",,,,General Petite

"I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.",,,,General Petite
"I liked the details on the front a d back of this top. while i was pregnant i purchased the white color in the small. everything fit, suprisingly, the top even covered up my pregnant belly. i returned it since i didn't want a top with so much room in the waist area post pregnancy. i recently got this top in the xs thinking that it will be a great stylish breasting top. while everything fit in the hips, and waist, the chest area was too tight. this top did not work for me as i am in between sizes",,,,General Petite
"Super flattering dress. love it. makes my waist look tiny. great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant! i love the fabric. will be great as a travel dress (packs easy, doesn't need to be ironed really, substantial fabric). love it. i think it runs large since i'm rarely a 2 at retailer, but i find that maeve runs all over the place. i'm usually a 4 at retailer and i got a 2 in this.",,,,General Petite

was tight, but they are supposed to fit tight. if i wasn't so ""hippy"" i would have kept them. the model is
slender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute, but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.",,,,General
"I love this blouse. it reminds me of something out of europe with the swiss dot and crochet delicate sleeves. i ordered the xsp and it fits perfect. i'm 4' 11"" so the shortness of the top isn't a factor. the material drapes nicely and doesn't make me look wide or boxy. i was afraid that the sleeves were going to be overly puffy put luckily they are not. the only thing to note is that the color is more on the tan / beige side rather than pink. i find with a lot of retailer tops that the colors are",,,,General Petite
"I purchased in the raspberry, love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool, and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.",,,,General

"Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing, but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.",,,,General
"I ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side. the fabric has a waffle texture that's lightweight but warm and cozy. i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture. my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck. that opening is really small. it just didn't suit me, so i returned but recommend giving it a try if it's calling your name.",,,,General
"I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store, tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.",,,,General
"This top is my favorite spring item. the color is a soft petal, but it doesn't wash me out (i'm a sandy paleface), and the details make it special. the cut is a little wide (i sized down), but it's also forgiving and perfect with slim pants or a pencil skirt. it's really a find.",,,,General

The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how,,,,General

"This dress is made of a wonderful, thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck",,,,General

"This is a great top and worth the money. nice flow to it, soft material and light weight for hot summer days. many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami - this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates. don't miss out!",,,,General
"I love this dress and would have bought it on the spot without hesitation if i just had an event to wear it to! i am plus sized (18 pants, 16 dress, 5' 7"", 36-38 ddd) and i never size down but i was able to with this dress because it is so flowy. the dress hit just below my knee and the only fit difference i saw when i tried on the petite is that it was slightly shorter (still no thigh showing). this would be flattering on absolutely anyone! if you are worried about bulges this dress will give y",,,,General Petite
"This skirt is beautiful, i even have the perfect shirt to wear with it, sadly, though, i have to decide between too many nice things... what to do! i tried on the 0, and it fits me perfectly. above the knee, waist just right (26.5 in). colors are fun and great for fall, but could also summer-ize the skirt.fabric is thick, however, and well-made. i highly recommen, but leave a 0 for me!",,,,General Petite
"I purchased the purple motif in petite size small. it hits just the right length for me, but i can see that if i were any larger chested, it might be an issue. (for reference, i'm a 32d, 5'4, 112lb.) it's very forgiving on the tummy area, without looking bulky (other moms know what i'm talking about and understand my appreciation for this). the shirt is also a nice quality, really comfortable, and it's easy to wear with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc., making it a welcome versatile piece.",,,,General
"This was really cute and fit true to size. the only thing i didn't love was the dip on the top left side of the tank near the cleavage. i probably shouldn't have been surprised since it actually shows up in the picture on the model, but it doesn't lay flat correctly there like the right side. either way, it's still very flattering and cute.",,,,General
"I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.",,,,General Petite
"I purchased the coral color. i'm usually between an xs and small in this brand, and i felt the top runs a tad small, so the small fit much better. simple and flattering top.",,,,General
"I got this skirt earlier this week and wore it for the first time today. i love the color and the shape. everyone else loved it on me. it looked great with a buttondown. but, i will say that it's short. i'm usually a petite in bottoms, and i wore tights so i wouldn't flash anyone when i bent down. i can only imagine how it would be on a taller girl. it also fits at the natural waist instead of the hip. i'm usually a size 6 in bottoms, but i bought the size 4 because it sits higher up.",,,,General Petite
"I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.",,,,General
"This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!",,,,General
"I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl",,,,General Petite
"The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink, which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine, unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!",,,,General Petite

This shirt is so cute. very casual. looks and fits exactly like the model and a basic retailer fit around the waist.,,,,General

"If you're looking for pretty and flowy, this is it! i frequently wear xs in retailer sizing, but in this top i went with a s. 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a. love the top but debating on keeping it because i'm not sure the yellow color looks great on my slightly olive skin....great with legging capris for summer",,,,General

This is a perfect casual too to pair with jns and shorts for spring!!,,,,General
"I bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. ive received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i'm a small or xs in most tops. i am 5-2, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.",,,,General
"Nice to have colors rather than a solid top. i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much. i'm 5'8"", 140 and wear a size 6, tts. i like the cut and it's long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me.",,,,General
"This top is beautiful and fits true to size, 4ft 11inches and 114 lbs and i purchased the xs. i was at the montclair location today and they had this top in white, lavendar, the pattern which is displayed online and gray. the white was see through so you will definitely have to wear an under garment with it. this top will be perfect for the spring with a cardigan or by itself in the summer. i still have a little stomach left over from my second pregnancy and this top hides it well. i decided to",,,,General

"Love this top! such a fun pattern and style. soft too! easily paired with a sweater or light weight denim/cargo jackets for fall. i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a 2 which is a perfect fit. it could be a tad more roomy in the chest, however the 4 would be too big overall.",,,,General
"I purchased the teal/blue version and the colors are slightly muted, but very pretty. i wish it were a tad bit longer, but if you're looking for a shirt that does not look like a tunic, this is ideal. it's cotton, so it feels like a t-shirt, but with a much more elevated design and cut. a cute and easy top!",,,,General
"I was impressed with the textured knit of this piece, which looked nicer in person than online, and the open neckline with a contrasting stripe. i really liked that the whole bodice was lined with a sewn-in lining from neck to hem (minus the sleeves). i would have loved the dress overall but my usual size small was snug at the hips and it would have just made me too self-conscious for that reason. sadly, i have to return mine, but i would certainly recommend the style for someone with slim hips,",,,,General Petite
This was the best purchase of the summer. it's cute and comfortable without being too baggy/loose. i get compliments every time i wear it. fits true to size. i bought the floral (orange) one. couldn't be happier!,,,,General

"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!",,,,General
I bought this in blue and love it. i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses. i ended up with an extra small petite in this. it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough. i highly recommend the dress if you size way down.,,,,General Petite
I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.,,,,General

This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.,,,,General
"Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.",,,,General
I love how it fits very flattering! the quality of the cotton part of this top is a little less in quality of that fabric than i expected. but i love this top and i foresee wearing it all year round!,,,,General
The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!,,,,General
This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.,,,,Initmates

"I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!",,,,General
"When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.",,,,General Petite

"My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual. 

 i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.",,,,General Petite
"I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. i've worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase, no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but it's really not that sheer so you don't need to. it's a lovely piece",,,,General Petite
"The print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice weight. i actually bought this because i'm early in pregnancy and wanted a dress i can wear during the transition period - because of its swing shape, this is one of those rare dresses that looks good on me now and will still look good on me in 6 months when i've got a huge belly.

fit-wise: i am 5'9, 155 lbs, 34d, and ordered a large, but i am exchanging it for a medium. the arm holes are also a bit large.",,,,General Petite

"Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.",,,,General
"I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to. 
other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.",,,,General Petite

Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,,,,General

"I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.",,,,General

"This is a lovely dress - however, there is a weird flap of fabric under the bow that doesn't sit right. it feels a little like a bib. if i could get it to sit right, i would keep it. every angle of the dress is lovely except for head on - which is a small problem.",,,,General Petite

"This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy, feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully, i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it's a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful",,,,General

Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.,,,,General

"I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt, sweater, cardigan + t, whatever, and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.",,,,General
"This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.",,,,General
I wasn't sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on. it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch. i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft. as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small.,,,,General
"I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d, 31"" waist, 38.5"" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it, but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased.",,,,General

"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.",,,,General
I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.,,,,General Petite
"I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.",,,,General
"This dress is so flattering, i had wanted to try it on for awhile. when it hit sale w/ additional % off i headed to my local store. the dress fits like a dream, so darn cute for summer, in cali we have a lot of summer left. this dress pairs perfectly with the gretta espadrilles. my usual size small was perfect. hurry and get this perfect dress before it sells out!",,,,General Petite

Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me,,,,General Petite
My review isn't really about the jeans! i want the top!,,,,General Petite
"Soft, silky, lined in silky natural fabric, hangs great without being weighty. extremely flattering on my xl short body. i'm petite, but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes, so they go just a hint over my knees--exactly what i need. lovely details: sequins and weighted tassels. highly recommend!",,,,General
This is my very shirt i have ever bought at retailer! it's very comfortable and fashionable.,,,,General
"I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress. friends, strangers, younger, older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress. it has a 70's vibe to it, fun and swingy. perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler, i think it will look great with leggings and boots. i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite (i'm 5'4' and 135) and it hit just above my knee. my favorite dress right now!",,,,General

"Beautifully embroidered dress.  it's loose fitting, not meant to be tailor fitted, so it would run large to you if that's what you were expecting.  the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow.  if you are hoping for a fitted look, size down one size.  there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist.  i generally go between 00p and 0p, and got this in a 0p (though either would work).  it comes to just above my knees at 5'2"", 110, 32-24.5-32.",,,,General
"I saw this in the store and decided to try it on. it is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i didn't think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front. when i put it on, i didn't mind them at all. it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors. dry clean only is the only drawback to this one.",,,,General

"I love clothing with elements that elevate them from basic to extraordinary. this tops does that for me: the black is a rich dark charcoal grey, the modal fabric blend has a nice feel and drapes well. however, the cut is very body conscious and i found both the medium and large tight in the midriff (my problem) area. since i love it so much, i will keep the medium since the sleeves are looser on the large. it looks exactly as pictured and would fit well on someone with a waistline.",,,,General

"I understand the style of this dress is ""swing"", but there is just so much fabric, and it looked a bit like a tent on me. i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over. the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely. this style would probably look better on someone smaller-chested, because there is no waist, it falls out from the bustline. cute dress, but i would size down.",,,,General

I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.,,,,General Petite
"In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l, which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all, a great purchase.",,,,General Petite

i'm an hourglass shape, and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest, but this top drapes down nicely. however, loose shirts like this aren't my style, so i belt this at my waist, and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider), and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10""). i also appreciate that the armholes are small,",,,,General Petite

Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.,,,,General

"This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2"". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.",,,,General Petite
"I wasn't planning on loving this dress when i tried it on. i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it. this dress fit perfectly. it hugs my body without feeling tight. the ruching is perfect. i didn't want to take it off! it's also very comfortable.
i'm 5'1"" , 107lbs and the xs petite fit perfectly. the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured. i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter. i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer",,,,General Petite
"The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.",,,,Initmates
"Cute jacket, but size didn't work on me. 5'4, 135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops, but m in jackets. ordered the medium, but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer, but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.",,,,General Petite

Like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim. looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants,,,,General Petite
"Yeah i know that sounds ridiculous. but this is really a nice piece, the fabric is thin and soft with a little structure to avoid any pajama vibes. the color is perfect, a mid-deep indigo with just enough fading. i don't find it unwieldy or challenging to get on and off, and i like how the fit is adjustable with the waist tie. that said, it does run small. i'm usually a 6/28 and started off with a m. it was pretty form fitting, and the ct risk was at orange level. then the zipper wouldn't stay u",,,,General
"I was attracted to this sweater because of it's unique style. i really love it. it looks just like the picture. it is of good quality, as is the leather belt. it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it's different. i highly recommend this sweater.",,,,General
What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.,,,,General Petite
This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over. i ordered a m and returning for a small. hopefully that works.,,,,General
"I'm 5'0 and 114 pounds and got the small petite. i have broad shoulders and am slim hipped. i no longer have a waistline, thanks to having given birth, but this dress really hid that. it gave me a figure! the ruching is super flattering and the material has enough support (with stretch!) to hide any unsightly rolls.

so why did i return it? i did, after all, get many compliments from females while trying it on. they loved the color on my pale olive complexion (i'm filipino with -ahem- blond hair",,,,General Petite
"I'm so glad that i took a chance on these; they're fabulous! i wasn't sure about sizing since my local store didn't carry them, but as a wider-hipped 14 i went with the xl. it was the perfect fit and i couldn't be more pleased. the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage (not that you'd need it- there's no show-through whatsoever.) love!",,,,General Petite
"This dress is gorgeous in person and so comfortable. i wore this to a business meeting and got several compliments on it. i am 5 feet tall and it does run a little long on me, a petite small hits me slightly below the knee. however, the dress is so nice that i am keeping it.",,,,General Petite
"I thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit. after trying it on in a store (must have been a return), i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small. the straps were a little hard to manage. it is cute and i think cuter than on the model.",,,,General
"This is a great basic shirt. it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not. it is also extremely soft. i am 5'9, a 10 and the m fit just right.",,,,General Petite
Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.,,,,General Petite
"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!",,,,General Petite
"This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look, size down. very cute.",,,,General
Love this skirt. it was on my wish list from the first time i saw it in the catalog. so glad i was able to get it when it hit sales. i love it. thr color is more subdued than pictured but very nice anyway. the cut is awesome and flatering pretty true to size for me (petite) winner,,,,General
"I love this skirt, in theory. the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent. however, being suede, the skirt was very bulky. also, at 5'8"" and liking skirts to be long enough for work, i typically don't have problems with long length. however, i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style. i really wanted to love this skirt - hopefully they'll make some updates in future styles.",,,,General
"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!",,,,General
"Pros: this skirt is a stunner. beautiful, rich color and great quality. the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate, but the little peek of above-the-knee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as well.

cons: slightly smelly when it comes out of the bag- i'm optimistic this will mostly go away though. expensive.

fit: i'm 5'8"", 125 lbs, 34b, normally wear a 26 or 27 in pants, and the size 2 fit great. i often wear a size 4 in skirts despite a size 2 fitting fine in",,,,General

I could not tell from the picture but it is see through. it will be fine with a tank top i just was not expecting to need one.,,,,General
"I'd been eyeing this for a long time but couldn't afford the full price. when it came on sale, my size -- regular 8 -- was sold out. so i took a chance and went with the petite 8 (only difference is length). and am i glad i did!

it fits beautifully, even a little roomy. but the length is perfect. the longer pieces are at/barely below the knee, and the shorter flap is about two inches above. (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 135 pounds, measurements 38-30-38.)

the skirt is substantial, with high-qualit",,,,General
"Love this substantial pieced suede skirt by leifsdottir. the photos i posted show the color in daylight on a cloudy day. a bit more muted darker turquoise than the online pictures. imagine a mini pencil skirt made of non-stretch polyester with a suede front panel. over this is the longer, open skirt, which is attached at the sides to keep it from flying up when you walk.

"Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 32 or 33, possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad",,,,General
"Coat is very soft and comfortable. runs large; usually wear an xsp, could have gone with an xxsp, if it came in that size. the lining is very soft. can wear a sweater or something heavier underneath, if needed.
some small, little pulls on outside fabric, but, might be part of the fabric. outside fabric is very soft. would not have paid full price; glad it was on sale, as i had been eyeing it for some time. it is cute, and felt like twirling, when put it on!",,,,General Petite
"I was hesitant to buy this dress with all the reviews regarding poor fit, particularly in the bust area, but it's so unique that i decided to give it a try anyway by ordering a petite size. i was pleasantly surprised to find that it fits beautifully in my usual size. i did not find the bust to be small at all, and the overall fit was very slimming and flattering. for reference, i am 5'2"" 110lbs 32dd, and the size 2p looks great and is very comfortable.  the 0p might have worked too. the material",,,,General
"I absolutely love this top. i am short (5'2"") but curvy on the bottom with a 36dd bust. i ordered the xl, only because of my upper body. it fits great, as i don't like anything to hug my body. but it doesn't look like a tent. has a little a-line shape to it. another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes. ordered the grey and will order in the black, also.",,,,General

Love this top. work appropriate and dress down worthy. i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist. comfortable fabric.,,,,General

"I loved this top, and i normally order petites when i'm able to, but this wasn't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular. just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow, it is a petite! but its not, just runs small. i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms, and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out. i actually thought it was a bit too short too, even on me (5'2"", about 118 lbs",,,,General
"I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but, for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.",,,,General
"This dress is a beautiful vibrant color and a classic fit and flare fit. it does seem to run a bit large, i am 5'0"" and 120 lbs. and wore a 2 petite. it fit nicely and was flattering but still a little roomy. 

i added a beaded belt to dress it up for my maid of honor duties and despite all the running around, dancing, hugging, buckling the brides shoes and holding my children the lace did not fray and the shape held up beautifully.",,,,General Petite
"I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine, but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining, which i suppose is there to combat the thinness, but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue, it wouldn't have been so bad.",,,,General Petite
"Like other reviewers have stated, this dress does run small on the chest. i'm 5.3"", 32c, 120lbs and size 2 fits me great. however, if my chest size had been, like 34d and up, size 2 will not fit me although i'm petite frame. so, if you have a large chest, i would recommend going 1 or 2 sizes up. if you are like myself, small bust person, then you should try your regular size and one size down to see which one fits you better. i was going to try size zero, however as soon as i tried size 2, i rea",,,,General
"I tried this on at the store and i agree with the other reviewwers on the sizing. instead of purchasing my usual size 6, i bought the size 8 as it was indeed a bit tight in the chest for my 34d chest but it was no biggie as they had my size. i love all the embroidery and lace, the length, color and detail on this one. it's also soft and made from cotton so it will be just perfect for summertime and will look adorable with tights and boots and a cardi or jean jacket in the fall:)",,,,General
"I swooned over this dress when it first came online. i had never worn a petite size before so i wasn't sure about the fit. i am curvy (34dd-27-42) and normally wear a size 8 dress, but the 6p fit me like it was made for my body. i think this is because the dress runs large, but i really really enjoyed the fit. the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue, which i adore. the lace feels like a soft cotton, but has a lot of strength to it. cannot recomme",,,,General Petite
"Ok, here is the story: i am 5'5"", 118 lb, 34c. i got a 4 and a 6, both are s tad tight at the chest and shoulder area, but i have big shoulders; i am keeping the 6. there is plenty material at the waist and below, but the dress does not look frumpy, at least on me it does not. i like the picture with the belt and i will wear it that way too. i also like the sleeves, they make it easier to wear at work. the material is lovely and so is the embroidery and cut-out. it really is a sweet summer dress",,,,General
"Despite the mixed reviews, i went ahead and bought this in my normal size. i am small-chested (34b) and found this to fit perfectly, so i understand why those with large chests were finding this impossible to fit at the top. the fabric and detail are stunning on this. there is not a lot of give to the fabric, but if you are smaller in the bust. buy it!",,,,General

"I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe, and while the color didn't disappoint, everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin, i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear, but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...",,,,General
I tried this on in store in a small and then ordered the medium online i loved it so much! i generally run a small/medium with retailer so i thought this was pretty true to size. i'm also longer through the torso so the medium is better for me to cover my stomach when tied.  it is on the thinner side but not see through. perfect for layering and for a mild california winter. can't wait for it to come!,,,,General

the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.",,,,General

this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things, the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy, but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7"" and it hit me right at the knee, so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring",,,,General
"This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch, the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all, so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality, i would definitely look into other items from this brand, but back this dress went.",,,,General Petite
"This hoodie has a lovely, flattering drape and fits true-to-size (m for me), and is light but quite warm. the cottony nylon layers along the front panels and hood add style. it will be warm enough as an outer layer on a slightly brisk day or indoors in cooler weather. i was going to opt for the blue, but in the store, the light gray ~ which is a bit darker and more marled than online (at least on my monitor) ~ looked really lovely and seemed more versatile.",,,,General Petite

"This sweater just arrived in my mailbox and it's already my favorite piece of clothing. it is the softest thing i own... and it feels so luxe. as the reviewer below noted: yes, it has pockets. they are slit-style pockets (probably why you can't see them in the photo) and the opening is trimmed with the same cable detail featured on the front of the sweater.

"Tried this in store today and id say it is exactly as pictured (length is similar on me at 5'7"", colors as shown, cut is loose but not overly sacklike). my normal size s fit loosely, but not in an unflattering way. sizing down might have been too narrow in the shoulders. the embroidery seemed to be good quality, but the fabric itself was on the thinner side with no lining. i would have liked to see a liner at this price (and probably would have bought), but i think i'll wait for a promo or sale",,,,General Petite
"First of all i need to state that i am 5,1"". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel, it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan, there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c",,,,General

"This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress, which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it.",,,,General Petite

"Oh wow no.
as the previous reviewer said, much lighter than the picture!
rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe?

"All the positive reviews are right - the shirt is great! something not entirely obvious from the online photos is that there is a slit on both sides of the shirt. makes it even more comfortable and flattering. i wasn't sure how i was going to style this for the winter before i received it but as soon as i put it on i had plenty of ideas. it looks particularly great with a chunky scarf, leggings, and boots. it looked great with a close fitting turtleneck underneath. it really can be dressed up or",,,,General

"Adore the bright embroidery against the black background!  mine was well done and no loose threads.  although this is all synthetic fabric (which i hate paying for!) but i couldn't help myself once i tried it on.  it's very roomy and if you're slender, size down unless you prefer the breezy swingy look like i do.  this is a three season dress that will do well with layers and without.  i picked regular hem instead of petite and it actually looks slimmer on me than the shorter version.",,,,General Petite
"I'm glad i saw this item in stores, otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp, and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!",,,,General Petite
The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person. perfect dress for fall.,,,,General Petite
The only strange thing is the size. i used to wear size s (117bl) but this time the small is way too big. i still keep it and put a belt on. it is a very very pretty dress. i used to buy sale from antheropologie. but can not wait this time. i am very impressed by the design. can not praise more!,,,,General Petite

"Picked this up in the white, and it's adorable. i'm a 2 in maeve blouses, usually just to fit my bust. i picked it up in the 2 because that's all my store had, and it fits. it's definitely tight across the bust, but not constricting. the shirt has no give, but it's still comfy, and to be expected from 100% cotton. the peplum is very dramatic high-low, and poofs out in the back also a little dramatically but gosh that's what makes it so gorgeous! great blouse, so precious.",,,,General Petite

"I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model. it's meant to be loose & flowy so i think it's true to size. everything matches the photos--the sleeve length, hem, neckline, etc. it's not a slimming look but doesn't make me look bigger than i am either.

the material is a very soft cotton. the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty. there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves. the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft. it's washed well",,,,General Petite

This dress is so beautiful & fits my hourglass figure perfectly. it's fully lined & the print is nicer in person. very easy dress to wear to many summer occasions! i'm an 8-10 on top & 10-12 on the bottom. size 10 dress fit perfectly!,,,,General
"Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.

Chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i'm usually a small/medium and thought the medium had a better overall look - sleeves were just a little long. the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top.,,,,General
"I bought the red cardigan because i didn't have anything similar and was so pleasantly surprised by the fit and design that i'm going have to buy it in whatever other colors are available. it's very versatile - looks great tied in front, in back, at the side - and has a tiny bit of flare at the bottom so it's more feminine and flirty than your average cardigan. i have a few tops by this brand and have been really happy with the quality and design.",,,,General Petite

What a nice sweater! i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters i've gotten in a long time. the fit is true to size. the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms. the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing. the weight is perfect for every season. i am very happy with everything about this sweater.,,,,General Petite

The front of this top is pretty thin and you can see through it,,,,General
"This top's subtle golden shimmer from the metallic thread used in the detailing is really nice. flattering, a bit special, all in all nice. but the white is see through, and the green somehow reads much more casual, at least to me. so a good top for times when your top being sheer isn't such a big deal but probably not for the office.",,,,General

The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.,,,,General Petite

"I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good, though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu. 

i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia",,,,General
"I ordered this a little big because the smallest size that they had was a medium. i probably could have gone with a small, but given that i am a 34d on top (and @ a size 2 on the bottom & @ 120lbs), the medium fits me just fine. it is super soft, and you can wear it with just about anything. keep in mind that your midriff may show a bit depending on how high your bottoms are. however, i paired it with a white pair of skinny jeans with a cute belt (so a teeny bit of my midriff was showing at time",,,,Initmates

"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",,,,General Petite
"Beautiful, comfortable and attractive sweater! my neckline doesn't stay flat as the one in the photo does, but i love the sweater anyway. great quality, attractive, and comfortable.",,,,General Petite
"I liked the look of this online, but it's even nicer in person. just the right length on the hips, a medium weight, and with enough interest and exposure on the shoulders to make it feel like a stylish option for a slightly cool night without falling into the too-heavy and makes-you-feel-dumpy category of sweater. like the slightly short sleeves too.",,,,General
"I feel in love with this shirt online and purchased it right away. this is one of the those pieces that makes retailer my favorite place to shop... stylish, unique and beautiful. it is a bit full in the bottom so i sized down from my normal s to xs and am very pleased.",,,,General
This dress is a fun idea- but the one i received had misaligned pleating so a few of the rows of sequins were tucked into the pleat- it threw the lines of the dress off. i ended up returning it but i think it can be amazing if you get one that looks like th stock photo.,,,,General
This has a classic tunic style silhouette with delicate gold threads. it looks even better in person than online.,,,,General

Got this shirt in the green color. it's long and flowy and fits true to size. super comfy.,,,,General
The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,,,,Initmates

This is my new favorite sweater. soft and comfortable and easy to wear to both work and play. being able to wear different things under this makes it very versatile and easy to change looks.,,,,General
"I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays, the length, the material, etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad, i would have bought it for sure.",,,,General
"I got the taupe and loved it so much i ordered the white and wore both this week alone! they are so cute and a great weight in this spring/summer weather we're having in the bay area. 
the taupe is a normal medium and a bit roomy, so ordered the white in a medium petite and it's pretty great. just depends upon how you like to wear it - both are lovely. 

my advice? get two - today! you won't regret it. 
order your regular size - don't size up or down!",,,,General

"I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest, it was shorter than i usually like my tops, so i will be returning it.",,,,General
This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!,,,,General

"This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.",,,,General
This is very cute but runs small. my typical xs is too small all over. arms are short and top is short and tight. i'll order a small and hope it fits.,,,,General
"I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great.

"Love this blouse, however upon every time i wear it, a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!",,,,General
"The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.",,,,General
"Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.",,,,General
I love an all cotton shirt! feels great and has a bit of quirky styling without being over the top,,,,General
I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldn't stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i can't stop thinking about it!!,,,,General Petite
I purchased this shirt in blue and i like it. the fabric is more of a stretchy/jersey material - didn't expect that. but the shirt looks decent on and is comfortable.,,,,General

"This top fits tts as shown on model. loose, flowy but the cut/details/flounce still give some nice shape. i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the style/make. went with the small in this. i am 5'5"",narrow shoulders, ruler shape 34dd. no gaping in the front. fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top. so complimentary, it would flatter many body types. the neckline is juuuuussst right, i fasten the top button to make",,,,General

"So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.",,,,General
"I got this in a petite xs; it's gorgeous and incredibly soft, great quality as well. my one little caveat is that it's very short; i'm 5'1 with a short torso and it still didn't get very far on me, but if you wear it with high-waited pants/skirt it's not a big deal",,,,General
"Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one, so i ordered down. it can go either way, it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.",,,,General
"This is my new favorite white top in my closet - the loose fit, flowy quality fabric, and effortless versatility are spot on for anyone's wardrobe. i took my usual size s - i wouldn't size down in this because although it's roomy in the torso, the sleeves and shoulders fit perfectly on my thin arms. everyone should have this beauty!",,,,General
"I bought the blue in store and loved it so much that my hubby recommended i buy the raspberry online! i usually buy a medium in tops, but went with the small so it wouldn't be so flowy. fabric is soft and not itchy. i will be wearing these a lot this fall!",,,,General
"The top is quite lovely and good quality. i ended up getting a size 4, which fit similarly to the model photos. i am smaller up top and wide in the hips, but the shape worked well for my shape.",,,,General Petite
"I think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year! it fits like a dream! i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an 8 (the only size they had left!). i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but the 8 was quite large, so i passed. after it went on sale, i ordered a 6 with my fingers crossed! glad i ordered when i did, as they sold out fast! fabric is a nice substantial weight, great for fall! the fit is great, not tight at all and more of an a-line on me, which is weird",,,,General Petite
This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design,,,,General
"I typically wear a 26 in jeans and in these i got the 25 and they fit perfectly. i ordered the 25 because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got. they are well made, a nice dark wash and with the size 25 a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit. i'm only 5'3"" so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled. i've worn them two days in a row and they haven't stretched out...highly recommend.",,,,General
I usually wear a 27 in pilcro and for these i have to size down to a 26. the 27 was very large in the waist. they are a great dark denim color and look cute with the bottoms rolled up a little.,,,,General

"I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs, slender bone structure. the medium fit well in the front but hung to the back of knees in back...just way too long. it would work best on someone closer to 6' tall.",,,,General
Much softer fabric than i expected. wrinkles easily.,,,,General
I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!,,,,General Petite
I am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly. i am usually a 10 or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders (for reference 5'9 145 lbs and athletic build). i decided to size down to an 8. the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured. it is a bit more substantial then i expected. the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer! it is casual in an elegant way. i will be pairing this with skinny jeans and/or white skinny pants. i cannot tell,,,,General
This is a beautiful blouse but it's gigantic. my bra size is 34d and i was swimming in a 2. the bust measured 42 inches at it's widest point. you can see the model is camouflaging the volume by holding her arms to the side. the fabric is pulled in an unatural way so the top is probably pinned for the photo. if you want this look go down 2 sizes. that much fabric is just not flattering on me so i am returning to the store. i'm passing on the 0 because the thin fabric seems like it will seriously,,,,General
"I love, love, love this top! it is beautiful and very unique. the first day i wore it i got so many compliments! highly recommend!",,,,General
I normally wear a small and sometimes a medium. even the extra small feels large all over and in the length. it's gorgeous though.,,,,General Petite
"I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.

as an earlier reviewer noted, the top is not see-through, a plus.

the drawbacks, though, mean that i will be returning this top. 

1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose, even in that size, and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives",,,,General
"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",,,,General
"I tried this sweater on and  loved it immediately! it's super soft and comfortable, and very slimming. i tried my normal size s and an xs, and decided on the xs as the s gave it (and me!) a bit of a wider look. love the navy color!",,,,General
"The positive: light-weight fabric, interesting drape

the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.",,,,General
"I'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways. it's a little long in the back, because i'm short, but overall i enjoy wearing it. it's comfortable, casual, girly, and well made. i'm happy with it.",,,,General
"A 3-season top that compliments jeans, dress pants, shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders, length just covers any belly flaws. i'm a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.",,,,General Petite
"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

"This top when pulled out of the box didn't look like much, the contrast of the buttons, wrinkly, shapeless... but, when i shook it out, tried it on i fell in love. it's so simple and versatile. prob the best white shirt i purchased this year, i'd say it pretty flowly, but that's the style and i love it. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i would purchase again, and in other colors if they had them.",,,,General

I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.,,,,General Petite
"This shirt is adorable.
but...it didn't work for me!
i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!",,,,General
"I bought a medium, my usual size, and had to exchange for a small. i love flowy sweaters, but this one truly fits one size big. the arms and body of the sweater fit larger. beautiful sweater with jeans or legging- can't wait to wear!",,,,General

"This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. it's 90 degrees one day, and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.",,,,General

The embroidery around the chest/collar is lovely.  but the lower half of the shirt didn't fit my post-pregnancy bod.  it's going back.,,,,General Petite
"I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it's not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.",,,,General
"I reserve my 5 star reviews for products that are made well, are a good value and have great style. this is one of those rare gems!

the top is just beautiful in person. very lightweight, almost voile-like cotton, so soft and drapey (and yes, you will need a base layer, it's meant to be very sheer) and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning.

"The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts",,,,General

Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!,,,,General

For reference i am 5'3 121 lbs and i usually wear a size 6 or 8. i got a size small and it was still at bit large. my bf said it was a nice dress to wear around the house ( like a house dress). a bit pricey for that but the way it hangs it does look like a house dress or a bit like a sack. i kept it only because i was looking for casual dresses. i wore it out and got a few compliments ( prob cuz i never wear dresses). good luck.,,,,General Petite
"Like most of the other reviewers, i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up 2 sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round, too.",,,,General
"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i came across it online. ordered the dress in a large and it fit perfectly. i'm smaller on top and larger at the bottom (pear shaped). the dress fit well and hid all of my ""flaws"". only problem was that it wrinkled very easily and im wondering if i received a dress that was sitting around for awhile since it was covered with lint and white fuzz when i received it in the mail. other than that the design was absolutely beautiful with incredible embroidery.",,,,General Petite
"Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.",,,,General Petite
"The fabric is beautiful, the embroidery quite striking, and the length is perfect. however, the dress is a bit amorphous; and as others have mentioned, the sleeves are silly. so i took the dress to my favorite seamstress, and she added a couple of darts in the back and fixed the sleeves - voila!. these weren't expensive fixes, and now the dress is perfect.",,,,General Petite
"Love this skirt! the material is so soft and flowy, but holds a nice a-line shape. i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small. i am a 26"" waist and purchased a 4... and i could probably have considered sizing up to the 6 easily as well.",,,,General

"The fabric at the trim and shoulders is crepe, which isn't clear from the photo. much nicer in person than online. runs large. i wear a large in knit tops (36d and to hide a soft belly) but this large was too big. armholes showed my bra and it was rather wide and boxy. i'll exchange for a m because i think i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer. a casual tank with a little spunk. cute!",,,,General
Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,,,,General Petite
"This is a good basic casual skirt, and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts, but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8, which fit well. i will say it's definitely a little snug though, even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy, and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.",,,,General

"With a skirt so vibrant, it's hard not to feel happy wearing it. i tried this on in store, following a spring fashion show. while i usually need petite sizes for length/proportion purposes (i'm 5'4, slender build), the regular size 2 was a great fit and length. any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt (and i don't necessarily mind a shorter length, but this was beautiful as it was). the price is a bit steep, but the quality of the material justifies it. the one",,,,General

one, it isn't a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt, the description states that it's a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",,,,General

"Don't judge the sweater by the model. it's an unattractive ensemble. the sweater is very pretty on. it's lightweight with a cute design on the back. i wear with skinny jeans or leggings. it runs a bit wide at shoulders but i'm petite so it could just be me. also, it says dry clean i think. but i put in a mesh bag and washed on delicate cycle by itself. then laid flat to dry and it was fine.",,,,General Petite

I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,,,,General

"I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.",,,,General

"I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.",,,,General

This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,,,,General

"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer, but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest, but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"", 140#, 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted, and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",,,,General Petite

"If you're looking for a sweater that's super soft and comfortable, you've found it! you could wear this almost anywhere except for a dressy occasion, but then, of course, you wouldn't wear it with a dress anyway. i wish it came in other colors because i'd buy several. it's on the thin side but not too thin. the only thing that i should mention is that it's not a black black but more of a faded or brownish black which is really obvious with black leggings or jeans.",,,,General Petite
"From the images, it looks like a basic black cardigan. look again because it's a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down. i'm 5""1 and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing i'd size up. it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and couldn't be happier",,,,General Petite
These run small in the thighs and behind just like most of the other cartonnier pants. i have four pair of cartonnier pants that are all size 10...which is a size or two up from my usual 6 or 8 in other styles. print is great! fabric is super lightweight and great for summer.,,,,General

"This sweater is beautiful, but is definitely more for looks than warmth. it's very soft, but very thin. i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned. i got the moss green color on sale, and i am glad i didn't pay full price for it--it's lovely, but certainly not worth $88.",,,,General Petite
"This sweater is exactly what you think it is. 

comfy! 

it doesn't have much shape (it's pretty boxy), but that's the point. it's not one of those figure flattering kind, but it's also not shabby looking. 

it's so darn comfortable and soft and the colors are so upbeat and beautiful. 

since it's a fuzzy yarn type of fabric, i think the fuzz might start to fall out eventually and i have to be careful not to snag anything on it because i don't want to pull the knitting loose.

The tie neck is super on trend. this will go great under a jacket or cardi. it's a keeper.,,,,General Petite

"Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag, i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy, grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.

wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate",,,,General
I bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal. sadly it's going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like. no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid. the details on the dress are pretty and it's high quality. just wish the fit was better.,,,,General

"I usually wear size 4 for dress, but this is the first time ever i have to go down to size 0, and it fits perfectly. well made, maybe a bit stiff around armholes, nothing major. i love the length as i don't like to show my knees. great color combinations, although this supposed to be a summer dress, it looks great for fall, just need to add a jacket, a pair of boots and i'm good to go, feeling pretty!",,,,General
"I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was, at least for me, a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude, there really isn't another word that i can use) and when you sat down, it is extremely apparent. i am 5""6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me, but again, i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle, it wouldn't ride up and look more fl",,,,General

"Runs true to size, with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit.",,,,General
"Very much in love with this ethereal, delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy, so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down, otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#",,,,General Petite
"Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it's for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it's beyond a-line, it's a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that's seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if",,,,General
"For reference i am 5'5 about 140lb, typically wear a size 6. luckily they had it in-store around me so i as able to try it on. i read the reviews and first tired on a size down, but it still didn't look quite right on me. i was daring and tried on another size down, and i'm glad i did! there is no lie that it runs large! it's a beautiful dress and heavy enough to wear into the fall! i will say it does still have a little ""tenty"" shape to it, but it's just the style of the dress.",,,,General
"Fully lined until just above the knee, silk exterior, rayon lining. can dress it up or down. very lightweight and cool-feeling. this is a beautiful dress. i'm 5'9 and it fit great-- shorter people might need to alter it. i tried it on in the store and felt like a princess, but am hoping it goes on sale.",,,,General Petite

Such a great classic top! very flattering! can be worn all year. i bought it in grey but think i'll need it in other colors!,,,,General Petite
I ordered the size xl and it fits me as it does on the model. it's true to size. it is made of a scratchier material but is still comfortable to wear. definitely needs a tank/cami underneath. i love the vintage look. it's worn well & washed well too. i'd love to see more versions in this same style. i'll get good use out of this in the summer and then will layer cardigans over it in the fall.,,,,General Petite
"Love the rushed sleeves, and the flower pattern on the side. t shirt is, however, a little thin, hence a bit sheer. but i loved it nonetheless... i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down (xxs petite) ad it is so flattering. going to keep it as i don't think petite is going to make it to sale... i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt, jeans or other pants for casual days!",,,,General Petite
"I love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top. the fabric is nice but the big, boxy shape on the bottom doesn't do much for you. i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump. returning the top.",,,,General Petite

only word i could think was ""average.""

"I purchased this tee in the neutral motif. i love it, it is comfortable and it's linen (my favorite fabric) it drapes well and the birds on branches with blossoms and fruit on the side are a beautiful understated touch.",,,,General Petite
"My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on. i don't normally go for patterns like this, but i thought it was cute and springy.

i tried on a large first, since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders. (i'm tall, big boned and 175 pounds) the large actually stuck out funny at the bottom and didn't do much for my shape.

the medium, however was great! it was long enough to hide my belly and cover enough of my waistband that i wouldn't",,,,General Petite
"I bought all 3 colors and couldn't be happier. love the cut, fabric, and colors. the fabric is light enough to wear in the hot summer of charleston, sc but not so light that you can see thru it. i love flowing tops in the summer that don't stick to you and this cut does that and is flattering as well. i've already work with shorts and a skirt. both looked great. easy to accessorize.",,,,General Petite
"This shirt is beautiful.its very light weight and great summer tee. don't hesitate to buy this, you won't be disappointed.i usually don't buy t-shirts that are quite this pricey, but i knew it might not last till it went on sale.runs a bit large and since it is linen, it will likely stretch a bit.(i have not worn it yet)",,,,General Petite
This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.,,,,General Petite

"This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust, but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust, although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.",,,,General Petite
This really is a pretty top. i do wish it was a little thicker but it's not as see-through as other tees i've seen.,,,,General Petite
"Not great quality, runs a bit lose, disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area)",,,,General Petite
This tee is so cute and well constructed. it's not a fabric that's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra!,,,,General Petite
"This is a pretty top- i like the bird pattern and the asymmetry of the design. it is nice that it is a natural fiber - linen - however, the linen is not super-soft against the skin. that is typical for linen, though with a snugger fitting item such as this tee, it may be more noticeable over time.",,,,General Petite
"I saw this in my local store and i fell in love with the bird pattern flowing down the right side of the shirt. for me, i bought the xs and the fit was great. i usually take a true s. the sleeves have a pulled stitching running down them and the top has nice shaping and flare to it. it is a wonderful little tee! the fabric is linen and not as soft as cotton but in this case it is not an issue as the tee does not cling to you.",,,,General Petite

"I was so excited bout this top. it looks adorable on the model but was not as flattering in person. the white is see through so you will need a tank underneath which looks off with the mock neckline. i bought the two other colors which are so pretty but the length of the top hit me at my hips. it def. does not have the length as described or measured in the description. i""m 5'5"" and wear an xs and the size was right but length hit at my hips which is my widest part of my body. if you have tiny h",,,,General Petite

"This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on",,,,General Petite
"This top looks so pretty on the model. however, the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted, so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller, this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c",,,,General Petite

"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8"", 180lbs, 36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!",,,,General Petite
"I like this top, and while it doesn't look on me like it does the model, i think it will be good for work purposes. would say it runs big and does have the maternity look risk (i bought this two months postpartum, so i need tops that cover the post baby belly and this works for that purpose). the grey is nice. bought on sale, but wouldn't recommend paying full price.",,,,General Petite
"I like this shirt because it can be worn for dressy or casual. i like the weight although i wish it was just a tad less see-through. i can get by without wearing a tank under but i usually feel like i have to wear one. i like the link. i feel like it runs just a little large. i love the length of the sleeves and the detail/cut of the sleeve. i like the colors on the shirt too. it's a good, versatile addition to my wardrobe!",,,,General Petite
"I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink.
the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso, so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body...
the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s), it covered my flat hips, fits just like the picture, but now my hips are showing :(
i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.",,,,General
"I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying ""maternity""and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut, but i lov",,,,General Petite
"Listen up gals - buy every color before they disappear!!! this top is amazing. so flattering, incredible fabric, the colors are divine and the price is amazing! i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever. a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in. i'm curvy - generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh. peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way, or look like a maternity top on me. this one is magic. hits a big longer,",,,,General Petite
"Just got this in - love the color and fabric, but it has no shape on me. i thought i'd wear a large because i have a 36ddd chest, but i should have gotten a medium, at the largest. also, even if it did fit, it came with a stain resembling toothpaste right in front. i'll be returning.",,,,General Petite
"I ordered this top in the pretty, sea glass green color. it is adorable on! it's constructed from a nice thick cotton and has a billowy swing look if you are into that, which i am. the cut of the neckline gives it a cool 60's vibe. my only issue is that the arm holes are cut small. also note that because of the wider neckline, i found putting a necklace on squashed it in a strange way. i'm still keeping it because it is awesome in every other aspect. most likely i will just jazz it up with fun e",,,,General Petite
"The shirt is nice, but not as nice a material as i was hoping, but i kept it anyway. but after washing it, it is even more disappointing, not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me, but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.",,,,General Petite

"I don't normally write reviews, but this shirt was so terrible, that i felt inspired. 

first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form.

"This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said, ""meh,"" so back it went.",,,,General Petite
"I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c, 127#. the moment i put it on, it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit, and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.",,,,General Petite
I love the length of the dress and the fun swing the skirt has. the print is wonderful.,,,,General Petite
"This dress is really pretty, but not made for girls with hips. i tried on my usual size 6 and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable, but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an 8 (typical of shifts i guess, but a girls can dream!). if you are a straighter shape, though, i would highly recommend.",,,,General Petite
It was purchased as a gift but truly amazing! the quality is fantastic and the owner of the sweater is truly happy with it!,,,,General Petite
The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring.,,,,General Petite
"This top! i was hesitant to try this on because it felt too busy, however it is a must have. it's just the right amount of lace and detail. i am typically an m in retailer tops (sometimes l depending on the designer; i'm a 32/34ddd). i initially tried a l in this thinking it had no stretch but ended up going with the medium. the arms were a tad tight but stretched slightly after an hour of wear and it fits perfectly everywhere. i think if you size up it will be too ""blousy."" highly recommend this-",,,,General
"Saturday/sunday never disappoints! love this black cardigan. runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me. not a problem anywhere else though. good medium weight to the fabric. durable quality and waist flattering once tied. great for throwing on over a dress, wearing with a t-shirt",,,,General Petite
"This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long, the sleeves are dolman style, and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent, but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin, if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!",,,,General
"I received this dress in the mail today, and while it is lovely and the drape is flattering, it will have to go back. i would need it in a xsp as the top is far too large for me, and the dress runs long for a petite.",,,,General
"This dress is as cute as i hoped it would be. i love the pockets and length and flattering cut. it looks great with boots and is perfect for fall. only con is that it is dry clean only. it seems like the fabric would do just fine with hand washing, and i will probably go for it. i just don't have the patience or organization for dry cleaning.",,,,General Petite
This is a great cold weather alternative to a coat especially in warmer climates. it is lightweight but dense. love the color.,,,,General Petite
This sweater is absolutely beautiful. the shape is very flattering both tied in front and in back. the wool is nice and soft and the color is a nice neutral that will pair well with anything. the stitching is a nice added detail that makes this sweater somethig special. it is a great addition to any wardrobe and i'm thrilled that it is part of mine. i can't wait to wear it!,,,,General Petite
"It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me, but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though, because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress, but i would not rec",,,,General Petite

"I fell in love the first time i saw it. the xs is the perfect fit. i generally wear xs/s or 2 in dresses. its not too snug to wear over a thin to medium thickness sweater. its a good length also, not too long, which i struggle with given my height of 5'3. the s was overall too big. its not itchy, though i've only worn it with long sleeve tops. its just the right weight. not too thin and not too heavy. its feminine and fun. wonderful topper for jeans, pants, or a dress. the color is versatile. sl",,,,General Petite
"This piece is gorgeous in person. it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything... it is more of a coat than a sweater. i bought one for my mom, and picked one up for myself when it went on sale. it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection.",,,,General Petite
"This was my first shot at high-rise bottoms and i love them. the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable. i just bought the bottoms so i can't comment on the top, it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match.",,,,Initmates
I ordered my normal size 6 in this dress and could barely get it on. it runs very small. i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up.,,,,General Petite
"This dress is beautiful. even my husband complimented it several times. true to size. due to the button closure in the back, you might have to size up if you are larger in the chest.",,,,General Petite
"This sweater coat caught my attention online, so i went in search for it at my local store. it's a flattering fit, across the chest and shoulders. very well made. the length is mid thigh. i am 5'4"" 125lbs. i went with the small, with the thought of wearing nothing too bulky under it. it does have an attached belt, that can easily be knotted together or each on its own for another look, if you opt to leave it open. it's light weight enough for cool days or evenings, but also warm enough for colde",,,,General Petite
"Comfortable, thick material ( think: structured sweatshirt material) easy to throw on and look as if effort was made - when it wasn't. sizing. i'm between a large and xl usually. large was perfect. i'm tall and curvy: ( 36g curvy) and this cardigan/ belted jacket/is very flattering.",,,,General Petite
"This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however, the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful, there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference, i am 24 waist",,,,General Petite
The lace detail is very classy. a great go to white dress.,,,,General Petite
"I am so in love with this dress. i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed. i am 5'6"", about 145lbs, 34d and the 4 fit perfectly! i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it!!",,,,General Petite
"I like the retro look but these seem to run large to me.  i get they are ruched on the sides.  yet, the bottom has a saggy look.  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom. i already took the strip out and washed so i'm keeping them.  very cute with a bikini top.  maybe i just need a bigger butt.",,,,Initmates
"I've been waiting for this dress to come back in stock and when it finally did i got it in the size 2. i'm typically a 2 or 4 in dresses and the 2 fits perfect. for reference i'm 5'6, 34c, 130lb. i think it runs on a larger size because it's a shift dress. i would recommend sizing down. a great white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner!",,,,General Petite
"This is one of my favorite purchases ever-from anywhere! one of my new years resolutions was to stop wearing work out clothes all of the time. this is as comfortable as any work out jacket and looks classy. can be dressed up or down. its warm, flattering and unique.",,,,General Petite
The material looked much nicer in the online picture. also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me.,,,,General
"I thought the sweater itself was beautiful, but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.",,,,General Petite
"This is a great staple top for your closet. its tremendously soft, a bit oversized, and drapes really lovely. in store there were also striped styles available, but i love the emerald green. the colors are absolutely perfect and will transfer well into any season! my only issue with this top (which inevitably is the reason i decided not to purchase) is the dolman sleeve. i'm al xl on top...so i'm never looking for extra width in anything i wear. the dolman sleeve really only looks right on me if",,,,General
This dress is a staple. if you don't feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable. this is it. will be great for travel as well. i like to pack light. so i look forward to traveling with this dress.,,,,General Petite

"This dress is really lovely. if fits and flows in a very flattering way although it is a bit long (i'm really tall so that's a very nice feature for me :p) it actually feels more linen-y than i expected to which was surprising, (i probably didn't read the product description close enough) but it was a pleasant surprise. can't wait to wear this to brunch/beach parties this summer! fair warning, it's also a little see-through - might want to wear nude underwear ;)",,,,General
"I really love these jeans! this is my second pair of ags and they're so comfortable. i will say that these jeans are super long! i have long legs and it takes a 3 inch lift from my shoes to get them to hit correctly. if you're short, you can expect to get them hemmed. the high waist is great! size down in ag because they tend to stretch and being high waisted they for differently!",,,,General
"Love this dress! it is very flattering and makes my waist look tiny. i don't care for the hem. it isn't terrible, but i wish it was cut straight across instead of curved at the bottom. i'll probably have it altered. comfortable, great for the office.",,,,General Petite
I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all,,,,General Petite

very versatile...can wear with jeans or dress up with all black.",,,,General Petite
"This shirt runs large in my opinion. i wish i would have sized down to a xs but maybe it will shrink a little when i wash it. its a great shirt, good quality and i'm very happy i got it.",,,,General
"Lovely dress that i recommend, just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic, the fabric is a great transitional weight, the fit is comfortable, and the style is classic.",,,,General
"I love this dress! i was actually able to fit in a l versus my usual xl due to the style of the dress. a bigger chest person (i'm a d) may not find the dress as well fitting as i do. overall great fit can easily dress it warm with a scarf, boots, hat or best. a great dress for fall-spring",,,,General Petite

"Got this for my daughter who lives out of town. i plan on bringing it to her during my next visit. i love it! the style is up to date and pretty. it's a perfect dress for almost any occasion! i'm hoping it will fit her, but the sizing looks right to me and the quality is great!",,,,General
"This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement, i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!",,,,General Petite

i caught my reflection a few times and thought i looked really bottom heavy. dress is awesome. worth it.",,,,General Petite

looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress. 

i love to wear with tan knee-high boots.",,,,General Petite
"Just recd the neutral & navy in the size s, my usual size in tops at retailer. just a heads up - it's way oversized under the arms. in the fashion world probably falls under the category of a dolman style sleeve. also the fabric is nubby like/pilled look. similar fabric is the 'warm-up pullover' that i recently saw at the store. i have a feeling this may be a new trend. if you are ok w/ the oversized underarms & nubby fabric then order up. if hesitant, wait & visit the store... i love the look of",,,,General

Good quality and design. perfect for casual office. definitely recommend. i don't know why it's called a cardigan because it's more like a casual blazer. note there is no button- just the tie to close. runs big. i'm 5'8'' 130# ordered the xs and it's roomy.,,,,General Petite

"Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner. the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different. it fits tts, but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress, which is nice. i am 5'9, 145 pounds, and the size 6 fit me perfectly.",,,,General Petite
"This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts, i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on, i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.",,,,General

"This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine, while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.",,,,General
"I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10, and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.",,,,General Petite
"I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!",,,,General
"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however, it doesn't even cover my butt, that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4"", i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.",,,,General
"Totally love this sweater - everything about it i find to match the model pics (fit, color, length). no dry cleaning required on this one, so i plan to get other colors to wear with leggings and skinnies fall through winter. i love that this is oversized without looking frumpy - it does have some shape to it and the knit falls perfects (not a heavy/chunky sweater...think soft mid-weight that you can layer with). worth full price!",,,,General

"This dress arrived with a black rope belt and belt loops. i did not see this in the photo. i thought it was a throw-on-and-go dress, not a belted dress. this, in addition to the weird sizing, caused me to return it. i am a size 4-6 in dresses and the size small i ordered was skin tight and bunched at the hips.",,,,General Petite
"Saw this on sale and tried it, not expecting anything and wound up loving it. i am 5'4 and it covers my thighs and rear well so i can wear it with leggings. it came mid thigh on me. the red is a rich burnt orange/red. i love that is is mostly cotton so i won;t get overheated.",,,,General

"This sweater was exactly what i was looking for...something well made, cozy, easy to just throw on and go and still look chic. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs and the x-small fit perfectly - still roomy but drapes well. i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous- more of a burnt orange than the red show here. i would definitely recommend this sweater!",,,,General
"I bought two of these in red and taupe. this is a great sweater for those of us who can't wear wool but need to stay warm. the cowl is adjustable with buttons, so not overwhelming even on a small person such as myself (5'2""). the texture is yummy and so are the colors. softness factor is over the top, too. i wish it came in black. have not washed them yet, so can't attest to that feature, but i am very happy with the quality, so far. thanks retailer!!!",,,,General
"Let me start off by saying that i really do like this sweater. the texture is very nice and, if it does start to pill, the material is one where i don't think it'll show up much (the fabric is a little ""bumpy"", but still soft).

i'm only giving it 4 stars because the sleeves could be 2 to 3 inches longer. i bought this sweater in both the red and tan colors (medium) i liked it so much. i've also never had a problem with long sleeve shirts/sweaters from retailer having overly short sleeves. however",,,,General
I wish this came in a petite size! i'm going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught. i'm busty (32 ddd) and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift. i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work. i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure. i ordered a medium.,,,,Initmates
This top is very cute. but the middle seam in off center near the bottom and cause the top to twist while wearing it. that is annoying.,,,,General
"This was a sleeper hit for me! it was on sale for a great price so i thought...what the heck! interesting diagonals in how the skirt is pieced together and i totally felt like a sexy mermaid! the only downside was that it was so long! i'm 5/2"" and expect things like this to be long but wow. luckily it was easy to shorten without loosing the cute flare at the bottom. i'm 135lbs and the medium fit snug but not trampy. i could have probably worn a large too but i don't plan on tucking my shirt into",,,,General
The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric. the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways. i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually 3/4 sleeve.,,,,General
"I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long, like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo, but i actually like that even better.",,,,General
"Beautiful dress, just like wearing a night shirt!!  great flattering fit for most figures!! wonderful color love the bell sleeves.",,,,General Petite
I hesitated to purchase this dress because of the color but it is a beautiful deep pink that i think would work with all skin tones. i ordered a size down as recommended by other reviewers and the dress fits perfectly. the feel is amazing - incredibly comfortable and not too short when you lean over!,,,,General Petite
"This dress does run large, but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is, and is nicely flowy, but might require a slip.",,,,General Petite
"As the other reviewer said, the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price",,,,General
"Love this blouse. per the previous review, there was no problem with my tailoring. it is exactly as shown. i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it. you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the office.

i do think it runs a tiny bit small. however, it is not short. it's just quite a fitted piece. i would consider sizing up. i love the look of the medium on me, 5'10",,,,General
"Love this! ordered it on sale, but i really do think it's worth full price! i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good too...i'm slender and 5'9"" about 125# with full bust. the small fits similar to the model, and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves (i have long arms!) and length, i went with the small. maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy! it's very well made and although you'll need a cami, i still feel as if it will be very cozy. perfect for our mi",,,,General
"This is my new favorite sweater and i want it in all sizes. i have the ivory and now the taupe-totally would have bought the green had it been in stock. the red is a more rust color, but it is still gorgeous. although the knit looks and is looser, it is still very warm. i wore it today and was a little too hot for this mild day. it is longer so it can be worn nicely with leggings and still look great, but it has a good fit and shape so as not to look frumpy. love. tts, but could also size down i",,,,General
"The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3"" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!",,,,General
"This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on, i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline, which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :(",,,,General Petite
Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.,,,,General
"The dress is lovely, but the sizing is off. the tag from retailer said it was a large, my usual size, but the manufacturer's size was an 8. too small, so i will have to return it.",,,,General
"I do agree with others that the draping does sit a little funny, but its nothing that a simple tack can't fix. this suit looks incredible on, and does a good job of hiding my ""mom pooch"" while still making me feel sexy with the cutouts. also covers the chest area well.",,,,Initmates
This dress is adorable. dress it up or dress it down,,,,General Petite
"Like many of the other reviewers, i thought this ran a little big. i am a 5'5"", 110lb pear and xs was perfect - i also ordered the small to be sure. it is not quite as close to the body as the picture. the color is gorgeous and saturated. it hits me mid thigh in a good way. the fabric is crepe on the outside and silky on the inside and it has a beautiful, high quality drapey-ness. it is unlined but not see through. it arrived wrinkled and sad, but a warm dry iron really brought out how gorgeous",,,,General Petite
I am so excited about this swimsuit. i have never felt so good in a bathing suit. it's sexy without being too revealing. the fit is perfect. i absolutely love it!,,,,Initmates
"I usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it. i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store. it's very cute and sweet but i don't think i can pull it off. the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen image.

this dress runs huge. i usually wear a 6 or 8 in retailer dresses and went with a size 2 for this one. it fits comfortably without being too baggy or like a tent. the materi",,,,General Petite
This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it weren't sold out in my size. love it!,,,,General
"I'm pretty petite and have small boobs so i should have gotten the xxs instead of the xs. however, since i'm currently pregnant (33 weeks) i figure i should buy the xs. it's a roomy dress and doesn't make you look like a boat if you're pregnant. which is awesome. since i don't have milk in my boobs yet, it's a tad roomy on the sides by my chest. not super noticeable though. i hate buying maternity clothes since they're pretty ugly and i don't like the fact that i wouldn't be able to wear it agai",,,,General Petite
This was exactly as expected. i ordered my usual size medium. fit well. good quality fabric. it's one of my comfy weekend go to items.,,,,General
"Beautiful dress but runs very large. it is made of a material that does not breath so if you tend to run hot, skip this dress. great style and looks good on almost any body type. colors are very attractive and is dressy enough for special occasions,",,,,General Petite
"This sweater is gorgeous, i wish i could have purchased in several colors because it's now a staple in my closet. downside- it does say delicate cold water wash, but the lace on the back is so delicate and pulling happens on the sides every time i wear it, so dry cleaning is the way to go. the sweater does snag easily, so don't wear anything that could get caught in it (jewelry/handbags with chains or embellishments) because they will catch.",,,,General
I love love love this top and have received many compliments. if anything it runs small (i wear size 6 and a 36d bra and the s was roomy),,,,General
"I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--
the description said it was black and white.",,,,General
These are such beautiful cheerful shorts. the floral motif just makes me smile. they do have brocade on them which is nice and dressy. they are perfect for a night out or a day at the beach. i went tts on them. i purchased similar shorts last year in the brown color. very nice shorts to have in your wardrobe..,,,,General Petite
"This top is so cute and i immediately had to purchase it when i saw it. i am usually drawn to boxy, cropped shirts, but i find this is harder to wear than i anticipated. it may be because i got a small size, but it is boxier than i anticipated and is almost hard to wear with even jeans. i recommend you buy because the detailing is so pretty and perfect, but try on and make sure you have some good bottoms to pair it with!",,,,General
"This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit, large if not). very cute too!",,,,General
"I typically wear boring shorts. you know - khaki. i saw these in the store and had to try them on. true to size in the waist, not too short, and the leg fit was perfect (slim without being skin tight). the pattern is far from boring. i can't wait to wear them out.",,,,General Petite
"So this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on sale?still pricey. i?m really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it. ordered it in the light red, size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summer?i wear it every week. the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way. if you don?t mind the price i would pick this up.",,,,General
This top is fabulous! the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful! i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it! my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that it's a score!,,,,General
"I wore this out to a dinner-party that was thrown for me, and people loved the surprise back. i have a few lace back shirts, but this one is gorgeous and sexy. i am incredibly cautious about the lace, however. it is so delicate. no issues, but just be careful!",,,,General
"This is such a great top for spring and summer. i've worn it with shorts, capris, and jeans, as well as layered it under a denim jacket. it brings an element of whimsy to any outfit. it's comfortable and really well made.",,,,General
I love the detailed cutouts on the shirt and the liner is finished with a scalloped edging. perfectly cool for the summer time but also stylish and hip.,,,,General
"This is a simple shirt, but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer! i'm ordering one in the blue and white as well... i know this is going to be a fave. i love supima cotton, and though i adore retailer, i do wish they'd carry more of the supima rather than the non-organic fabrics. so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy, because i prefer the feel of silk, linen and cotton. thanks for this one, retailer!",,,,General
"This top is a lot more striking in person. on, it's quite stunning. it is a tad short but that's part of the aesthetic and i don't find it unflattering. however, the first time i wore it one of the black rope/thread details disintegrated and fell apart. i tried to reinforce the end and reattach it but it just came apart again. i understand the nature of the top makes it more delicate, but this was definitely disappointing. i mentioned it when i went back into the store and the sales girl sympath",,,,General
"Love shorts that i can dress down w/ a chambray top or that i dress up w/ heeled sandals and a blouse. this is perfect!
i found them to run a tad big.

"I love the colors, my favorite. purchased a medium and fits perfectly. i've been wearing it all summer. material is thin but super soft. for reference i am 5'8"" 145 lbs 32dd. i'm obsessed with this tank. considering buying a second just in case anything happens to the one i have, that's how much i love this tank.",,,,General
"I purchased the teal suit and it was so beautiful! it's super comfortable and has nice coverage. i decided to return it because, as a nursing mom i've decided to wait until i've weaned the baby so i can make sure the fit is still good. but otherwise i would have kept it!",,,,Initmates
"This is one of those ""very retailer"" tops that you can't find anywhere else. the feel is ""folkloric"", but the country is not specific. although listed as a ""tee"", the material is a knit with heft and is lined (from the bust seam down). the embroidery is combined with cut-work to give it a high-end finish (and justify the price). this is a dress-up tee for sure. i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt. i wear either a 0 or 2 in mos",,,,General
"The shorts are very cute, very nice quality and intricate detailing! the sizing is tight in waist and very big in legs not flattering at all. i'm 5'1"", 115 lbs. they are going back.",,,,General

"The fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering, it doesn't stick out too far over the butt. the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall. looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights. i'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one.",,,,General
"In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.",,,,General

"This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely, but it was too short for me (5'7"") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly, too, the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it, which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you, great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter",,,,General
"This is an extraordinary blouse and it is the poster child of retailer. the embroidery looks beautiful online but i appreciate it much more in person. the details are breathtaking, especially the scalloped borders around the arm holes, neck, and hem lines. i grew up around embroidery art and this is very high quality work, not even one stitch out of place and no hanging loose threads either. i like the black thread on cream because it's classy and it displays the details. the blouse materia",,,,General

I bought this in the store and love it. seeing it online - i would never think to buy it. much more flattering in person!,,,,General
"I usually take a small in retailer tops. i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting. the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time. i love the green color though. i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me. i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin (even at sales price). overall though, i thought it flattering enough to keep.",,,,General

"I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra, its just too much. it's a very loose fit throughout the body, but the shoulders, arms, and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just can't do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.",,,,General Petite
"After reading many positive reviews i ordered. sure glad i did. i love the light, airy fabric. it hangs nicely. i am mostly a 12, sometimes a 14. i ordered both sizes and the 14 was a perfect fit. i am very pleased with this purchase. thought it might be too girly and/or young looking on me, but not so at all. i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too.",,,,General Petite
"This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all, i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.",,,,General Petite
"Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste.

I ordered the orange plaid version in size 16. it fit me like it does the model. it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. the plaid isn't see-through so no extra layer of a tank is needed. the neckline isn't too low. very well-made and a great choice for summer!,,,,General Petite
"This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering, it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape, but alas, i did not look good in this.

the material is very nice, soft and stretchy.",,,,General Petite

"I ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5'8"" with a long-ish torso. i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it's fairly short. color was gorgeous. the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me. those with small chests may have better luck. i left like a suburban mom in it.",,,,General
I love this dress. you can wear it for everyday or you can put some bling with it and dress it up. it fits very well. flattering. i highly recommend!!,,,,General
"This dress is very figure flattering.  however, it is not navy it's purple.  overall nice print, somewhat cheap material and zipper gets stuck.  i am keeping because it's versatile and i like the vintage floral pattern.",,,,General Petite
"The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the ""outside"" middle material, hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece.",,,,General
"Bought this somewhat on a whim during a promo in yellow, which is a lovely light cheery yellow (didn't make my pale skin look terrible). i love the detail of the dress and the swing silhouette. the slip is also of good quality. i don't love where the slip falls in the lace panel near the bust because it looks a little funny to me in a distracting way, but i'm keeping the dress. it's cute and fun :)",,,,General
I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.,,,,General
"I really love the style of this top. it's a great lightweight, breathable top perfect for summer. it is slightly sheer so i have to wear a cami underneath. it is definitely a flowy top, but flattering. i'm 5'0 115lbs and ordered the xxs. a petite size would've been better as it is long on me (it covers my butt in the back), but it looks good with a longer short or pants.",,,,General
"I love the design and the fabric, but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress, but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted, who knows?), so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric, it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou",,,,General

I think this is the perfect fall dress.  i did not have the cleavage issue because i am going to wear the little button buttoned at the top.  i like the sleeves can be pushed up or down depending upon your weather.  i thought it be very slenderizing.   i am thin on top but curvy on the bottom. i'm going to wear it with closed toe wedges but if my legs were thinner i think tall boots would be pretty.,,,,General

"I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good, not too right or lose. i took a size medium, which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me, also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.",,,,General Petite
It was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom. the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt. i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it's definitely not worth $60.,,,,General
Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.,,,,General Petite
I washed this on the delicate cycle and air dried - very happy to report that it washed very well and still looks new!,,,,General Petite

"This is a cool, fun sweater but beware of sizing! i started out with a small - which looked like i was wearing a child's sweater. i ended up with a large which fits fine but is by no means generous. to get the look of the model i'd need to be in at least an xl.",,,,General Petite
"I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however, the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5"", 125#, 34c), but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally, the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l",,,,General Petite
"I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going, but it was not, it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference, i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me, not ""cool"" long like some other sweaters this season.",,,,General Petite
"This sweater has potential, but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick, and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high, so i need a longer look. the color is true to size, but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.",,,,General Petite
"I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo, it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider, which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.",,,,General Petite
"I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!",,,,General Petite
I can not speak highly enough about this shirt. i originally bought the navy one and then went back to purchase the other two colors. the material is soft and thin without being flimsy. the fit is very flattering.,,,,Initmates
This dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didn't fit me right. i ordered a small since i usually wear a size 2 but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust. this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist. i guess i'm just too busty for this dress. too bad because i really wanted it to work. it is a lovely dress.,,,,General
"Versatile piece to finish out your look. love how it goes with so much of my wardrobe. simple, comfortable, and classic.",,,,General
Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!,,,,General Petite

"This dress is especially beautiful in person. the tulle doesn't snag and lays nice and flat, not point. this dress is easy to dress up or dress down, fits comfortably and has some stretch to it. the bodice does run a little high, higher than what is shown in the model picture, but lovely nonetheless.",,,,General
I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!,,,,General Petite
"I loved this dress. i am 5 ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight, but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long, but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it, which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.",,,,General Petite
This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!,,,,General
"I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on, the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.",,,,General
"I love the color combination, and the bodice is very falttering. it has a tiny bit of stretch. the tulle is also feminine, i love that i could wear this with a moto jacket... sizing: no need for petite, it was short enough in regualr size. i think petite would have been too short (unless you are younger:-))",,,,General
"I love this top--the fabric, the color, they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low, so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldn't show.",,,,Initmates
"Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is, however, not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd, the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted, it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked, as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!",,,,General
"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i wanted to love this dress soooo much, i wanted it for holidays, and special occasions, but my broad shoulders and 34d chest worked against me. the criss-crossed bodice accentuated my larger top, and there wasn't enough poof in the skirt to balance me out. i'm sure this will work beautifully on other body types, and i wish it worked on mine too! a sparkly necklace or dangling earrings and a high bun are all you",,,,General
"This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable.

"Love it! i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium. i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly. it is sitting pretty in my closet now. :) so if you are a size small, try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well.",,,,General
"This is a cute dress, but just not a keeper for me. the top portion of the dress is fairly snug. i am normally a small in retailer sizes, but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust. otherwise, it was cute and simple, and the tulle was quite soft.

i think that i would have gone with a medium, but i am wearing a small in the photo. for reference, i am 5'5"", ~135 lbs, 34c, and 27"" waist.",,,,General

Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!,,,,General
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! i love the colors and design however there are two issues with the dress for my body style: 1. it's not made for busty girls. i'm a 34d/dd and the small would have fit well (i'm 5' 6"", 147 lbs.) but my chest did not fit. so i tried the medium but then the overall fit was worse, which led to another issue: 2. the waist and pleating made me look a little heavy because i still have a small amount of baby weight/spare tire around my waist, which was highlighted wi",,,,General
"I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all 3 colors. when i saw this new one, i was thrilled and ordered it immediately. what a disappointment! why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing? the fabric is a very loose weave sort of ""homespun"" look, which wouldn't be a deal breaker, but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags. last year's styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move. this version is fully lined. yo",,,,General

This dress is perfection! very flattering and pretty.,,,,General
I really wanted this to work. the style and colors are great and it is comfortable too. i didn't like how big the skirt portion was or how stiff the fabric was. it looked like a plaid tent on me but not in a terrible way. it could work on the right body.,,,,General

"I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine, without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist, but it's still very flattering.",,,,General
The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.,,,,General
This dress is gorgeous! it is a little sheer even though it has many layers.,,,,General

"Got this 4 days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect, beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does, nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness, it is still warm. would buy this in oth",,,,General Petite

The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but,,,,General
I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.,,,,General
"I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.",,,,Initmates
I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn't long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.,,,,General
"I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide, i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely, i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.",,,,General

"Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips, the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition, i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.",,,,General

"I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much, right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl, having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life",,,,Initmates

This brand generally runs small but really this skirt is exceptionally small in the waist. i usually take an 8/10 in retailer bottoms and i had to go up to a 12! i love the details and uniqueness of the skirt. i like the shape and very much my style in a skirt. fabric is soft . i waited for sale plus promo and it was then worth the purchase. it reminds me of an old school retailer style .,,,,General

"I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft, but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.",,,,General Petite
I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring. this one is edgy and the design is amazing. it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons. i found the fit to be on point. my normal medium fit perfectly.,,,,General Petite
This jacket is perfect!! the denim mixed with the military style is such a good combo. it fits great and is very comfortable. the little ties in the back are a cute addition.,,,,General Petite

"I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top, perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though, i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!",,,,Initmates
"Fits nicely, casual and lightweight for the summer and i like the look of the cross straps in the back. no complaints!",,,,Initmates
"I hesitated to buy this after reading the earlier review, but went ahead anyhow, and am glad i did! i ordered the white in a small petite, and it is as cute as can be. it is crisp and true white, not off- white. there is a large pleat on one side of the front to give the blouse some interest, and there are openings on each side which allow the blouse to swing a bit but do not open up to reveal skin. it is not long, but by no means is it cropped. it is really sweet with slim jeans or slim printed",,,,General Petite
This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers. so many nice details and a great fit!,,,,General Petite
"This is a really soft, nice, summery top. i love the criss-cross detail on the back, as well as the button down. it fits looser around the stomach, but not in a trash-baggy way. 

it mostly fits true to size; the only issue is that the top button doesn't leave a whole lot of room if you have boobs at all. i wear a 34b -- pretty normal, not large -- and usually wear a small. i've found that the top button buttons fine, and looks good when i'm not moving, but it pulls a little when i move around",,,,Initmates
Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it's a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus,,,,General Petite
"This is a beautiful skirt. great, soft, draping fabric. fringed along the edges. i ordered size large, which was an okay fit, perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist. because i carry my weight in the tummy, this made me look wider than i am. as an elder, i just couldn't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee. i have great legs but my knees aren't their best feature. so sadly, returned but i do recommend.",,,,General
"I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year, but this kind of boxy, straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however, i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off, i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses, with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet), and i love it.",,,,General Petite
"This is a great sweater. it can be worn ""wrapped"" as on the model, or open like a cardigan. it is a lighter weight knit, perfect for how warm this winter has been. i love the deep purple color. normally between a small and medium and went with the medium in this sweater.",,,,General
Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better,,,,Initmates
"Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far, but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?",,,,General
"These are really nice jeans (i am a jean fanatic). some ""patches"" are faded others are dark with still others with stitching across them. very distinctive and nice. they are truly a boyfriend fit...so, if you them big, they are. ag makes very nice jeans both in fit and quality. i buy other brands, but not often...",,,,General
"I've owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day. not because they've ever needed to be replaced, but because i'm obsessed with the fit, the color and the style. when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception! this jacket is even cooler looking in person. the fade on the denim is totally perfect. not too dark, not too light...and not so distressed that it looks sloppy. the denim is soft just like all other pilcro, and the fit is a dream. what i love the most is the interest in the c",,,,General Petite
"I saw this in store and had to try it on! it is really cute. i love the different textures and the red drawstrings. it fits well, although i am somewhat between the small and medium sizes. i went with the medium in case i want to wear a bulky sweater with it. really cute and i have never seen a coat like it!",,,,General Petite
,,,,Initmates
"This is a very cute shirt with great details. however, it runs a little bit small. not as full cut as it seems.",,,,General Petite
"I love this sweater! i'm very sensitive to fabrics and this really doesn't bother me too much. it's soft, but just a tiny bit scratchy. but the color is a rich purple and the flexibility of being able to wear it draped or not is a nice touch. it comes right at waist length....little on the short side if you want to hide your muffin top, but otherwise a winner all around.",,,,General
"The fabric is soft and the wine color is rich and a good alternative for black. i love it so much and bought the grey one as well. you can wear it open or button up like on the model. great layering pieces. i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",,,,General
Amazing jeans!! without pockets on the front there are no weird lines like there are on other white jeans with pockets. the high waist is extremely flattering! perfect for spring and summer!,,,,General
"I wanted to love it, but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous, but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.",,,,General
"I am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. mih usually runs small so i ordered the size 30 knowing the length wld be too long. well the fit is great. i am a little curvy w/ slender legs. the size 30 sits just below my navel, snug throughout hips & thighs, then gradually begins to flare below the knee to the bottom. super long, will have to cut off abt 4-5"" to suit me. i don't wear sky-high shoes. i wear low to flat sandals in summer & medium heel booties in cooler weather. maybe i'll cut them & try them a",,,,General
"Yes, this is a sweatshirt, but one that you can wear in a a variety of settings. it's a little boxy, but i can fit a bright colored t-shirt underneath during the cooler season. be warned, the band around the bottom runs snug, which wasn't a problem for me because i have narrow hips.",,,,General
"I saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there. i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind. when i saw it on sale i grabbed it. the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect! not too short. the small amount of spandex is so comfortable. it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well. i am 5'4"". i can wear a med or large. i bought the large. it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves. not a typical denim jacket. looks great over a",,,,General Petite
"Fits well, super soft and very flattering. great for layering and for dressing up or down. highly recommend!",,,,Initmates
"I had been eyeing this sweater since it came in for the fall mostly because of the beautiful purple color. it finally went on sale and i scooped it up. like most reviewers, i luv that you can wear it two ways. i prefer to wear it closed as i do not have the slimmest waist and this sweater hides this well but it looks just as good open and drapes well on the sides. this sweater looks a lot better in person than online like most of the retailer sweaters. i have hand washed this a couple times alread",,,,General
"This shirt is tough for me because i loved the front, which fit nicely, but i'm petite and the back had a giant extra piece of fabric that bumped out because of the cross straps, i wish it wasn't so wide so i could have bought it!",,,,Initmates
"This skirt is about an inch longer on me than on the model in photo (i'm 5 ft, ordered petite) but the length actually works. i have a bit of a tummy, so ordered size 4 - fits great. really love the colors - so many tops will go with this skirt, so it will be easy to vary the look.",,,,General
"I'm desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone. i wanted this cute print to work - and it can, but it's just not great. the material is almost spandex-y, which is a bit weird. the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps, making the neck and the arms higher than i like. if i go up a size, it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist. so close!",,,,General Petite
"This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat, i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.",,,,General Petite
"This tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable. i don't think the material is too think like the previous reviewer. i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length. not too long, but still able to front tuck. i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest!",,,,General
